It is likely that if you're working on upping your dpm, you will need to improve in one or many of these areas. The first step is recognizing what mistakes you're making, then work on the solution. Don't be discouraged if you don't get it right away, some of these mistakes are harder to fix than others. Remember, everything takes practice. 1. Cancelling channelled abilities late/early \u2b25 Asphyx \u2b25 Rapid fire \u2b25 Assault \u2b25 Destroy \u2b25 Concentrated blast \u2b25 Snipe \u2b25 Fury Why it\u2019s important: depending on what ability you canceled late, you will lose anywhere from 1-3 ticks every channeled ability you don\u2019t cancel properly. As an example, in a 5 minute gem you will do roughly 10-12 asphyxiates. Assuming you don\u2019t cancel any asphyxiates, that\u2019s 30-36 ticks that you\u2019re standing idle for. That\u2019s enough time for 10 extra abilities. Canceling too early is also suboptimal as you lose out on the damage from the channeled ability.

Threshold order in Sunshine/Death Swiftness/Berserk with Adren pot Why it\u2019s important: for Mage and Range, the expected number of thresholds with adren pot is 6. Losing out on a threshold results in big damage loss. For melee, the expected number with adren pot is 2-3 (depends on how many channelled thresholds, mbarge, or impatient procs).

How to fix: Use a dual-wield ability before activating sunshine/death swiftness/berserk, and immediately after activating your ultimate switch to a 2h and click on the target to obtain a free auto attack before the gcd is over. Clicking the target is only necessary if you clicked your pf/2h switch from your inventory. If you keybound everything, disregard clicking the target; the auto will come with no extra input needed. 6. Utilizing flanking in basics rotation Why it\u2019s important: remember that basic impact-flanking is a 260% ability and is better than dbreath in terms of damage. Not utilizing flanking in a basics rotation is losing out on using your best-damaging basic attack. How to fix: Practice, practice, practice. Make an effort to use your flanking switch more often. 7. Ability prioritization in basics rotation Why it's important: Prioritizing weak abilities over strong abilities when choosing the next ability just leads to lower damage.

Managing cooldowns of good abilities Using and putting all of the good abilities on cooldown right away and being stuck with only weak basics afterwards. Why it\u2019s important: the good abilities (dbreath, impact-flanking, corruption blast, snipe, binding shot-flanking, corruption shot) often come with a long cooldown. If you use all of the good abilities at once, you will be stuck with the lower damage abilities until all of the good abilities are back off cd. How to fix: by using \u2018filler\u2019 abilities such as Sonic Wave , Concentrated Blast , Dazing Shot , Needle Strike , Fury , Cleave , and Decimate (abilities that have decent damage with a short cooldown) in-between the strong abilities, you can craft a rotation where you will never run into a scenario where you have to resort to low damage abilities. \u200e \u200e 9. Losing ticks This can be caused by: a) not inputting the next ability fast enough, b) having trouble determining what is the next ability, c) clicking and/or being slow on weapon switches Why it\u2019s important: same rational as canceling channeled abilities. Losing ticks here and there will snowball over the course of a 5 minute gem. How to fix: practice, practice, practice. Try and think 2 abilities ahead and plan out your rotation. 10. Changing weapons mid-channel ability Why it\u2019s important: Changing from wand and orb to Staff mid-concentrated blast will lose you the crit bonus from the conc blast. This requires precise timing to make sure you\u2019re still getting 2 hits from your conc blast.

While we do not encourage using Revo++ as it limits the amount of control a player has over their own rotation, it is low-input and low maintenance. Revo++ can be desirable for afking, low-effort pvm, or slayer tasks. Here is an ability bar we recommend for Revo++. Using this recommended ability bar with zero player input you can achieve a DPM of roughly 130k. To toggle on revolution++ and highlight how many abilities to trigger with it, click the cog icon on your ability bar: Revolution Revolution (not revo++) is a combat mode wherein basic abilities are used automatically by the game but threshold and ultimate abilities are manually activated. Newer players may find this combat mode helpful starting out as it allows for some control over your rotation but doesn't overburden you with managing basic abilities. Below is an ability bar we recommend to use for revolution. Note that the thresholds and ultimate abilities can be placed in any order as it does not matter where they are on the bar \u2212 you will be manually activating them. If you are new to using revolution, simply let revo use basic abilities for you. Activate sunshine once you reach 100% adrenaline. From there use your thresholds whenever you reach 50% adrenaline (wm , asphyx , deep impact ). Repeat. Following this simple repeating pattern of Build to 100% \u2192 Sunshine \u2192 Thresholds \u2192 Repeat , one can expect to reach around 150k dpm with low-medium player input. Full Manual Full Manual is a combat mode wherein all abilities are manually activated by the player. No automatic inputs from the game means no damaging abilities will be done, therefore this mode requires high input from the player. The benefit of this mode is that it allows for the greatest degree of control over which abilities are used in any given scenario. Most high level pvmers opt to use this combat mode. While it does not matter where you place your abilities on your bar with full manual, you may still find it helpful to organize your bar based on basics to thresholds to ultimate. Refer to the revolution bars as examples. Transitioning from revo to full manual can seem intimidating but all it takes is practice. Most players start by letting revolution activate basics while they manually input thresholds and ultimates. The next step would be to manually activate basic abilities too, with revolution still active as a failsafe. Once you feel confident in activating basic abilities manually, try turning off revolution. An exercise to help you here is to only use basics for a full minute of combat on a combat dummy. Your goal is to not lose any ticks between basic abilities, either due to cooldowns or due to not manually activating the next ability fast enough. Once you get comfortable at a combat dummy, try on a real boss such as GWD1 (Graador/Kr'il/Kree) or GWD2 (Vindicta). There is no easy \"trick\" to skip past the practice. It takes time to learn full manual so stick with it! Ability Prioritizations & Building a Rotation Generally speaking, high damaging abilities should be prioritized and used more often than low damaging abilities. However, there's a catch. High damaging abilities often come with long cooldowns. If you use all of the high damaging abilities at once, you will be forced to wait for cooldowns before you may use them again \u2013 during which time you are forced to use low damage abilities. To circumvent this, the trick is to use 'filler abilities' \u2013 decent damage AND short cooldowns \u2013 in-between your high damaging abilities in order to pace your cooldowns. See this image for an idea of which abilities should be prioritized based on damage (in a vacuum) When building a rotation, ability prioritizations AND cooldowns should be on your mind. Filler abilities such as Sonic Wave and Concentrated Blast should be used in-between high damage abilities such as Dragon Breath , Corruption Blast , Impact-Flanking , and Combust-Walk . Any basic ability with damage lower than Sonic/Conc would be considered a weak ability (wrack , tuska , sacrifice , impact without flanking, chain on 1v1). If you are 2h or DW camping, you will be limited to only one filler ability (Sonic Wave or Concentrated Blast, respectively). Thus, try to utilize Sonic Wave or Concentrated Blast as often as possible in your rotation. A basic pattern of Sonic \u2192 Ability \u2192 Ability \u2192 Repeat is recommended for camping rotations. For weapon juggling, you will have access to both Sonic Wave and Concentrated Blast as filler abilities. This lets you have more breathing room in what rotations and fillers you create. While there is no singular rotation that is best here, a general pattern of Sonic \u2192 Ability \u2192 Conc \u2192 Ability \u2192 Repeat will give you strong dps. Measuring DPM - Challenge Gems and Runemetrics A good way to get an understand of where you are in terms of DPM is by placing a challenge gem at Combat Academy at Lumbridge and doing a 5 minute gem. Use your best armor, weapon, supreme or elder overloads, and the best DPS prayers you have available. After 5 minutes, divide your score by 5 to figure out your DPM. For example, a 750,000 score on a gem means 150k DPM. \u200e \u200eFrom here, it becomes easier to understand where your focus should lie as you progress up the DPM ladder. You may also use Runemetrics to measure your DPM. Simply set the mode to stopwatch on the Runemetrics tab and after 5 minutes of combat stop to evaluate your score. Rules for a 5 minute challenge gem at dummies: \u2022 Dummy must be in normal mode \u2022 0% adrenaline start \u2022 No aura \u2022 No Vulnerability \u2022 No familiar/dreadnips \u2022 No weapon poison or Cinderbanes \u2022 No active pocket slot item \u2022 No ruby bakriminel bolts \u2022 No Amulet of Zealots \u2022 AoE damage will be subtracted Here's an example of what should be brought to DPM practice with challenge gems. Your best gear for the style being used, adrenaline or replenishment potions, overloads, and ring of vigour. Other items to consider bringing if you have them are: planted feet switch, flanking switch, lunging switch, dragon rider amulet, guthix staff, powerburst of overkill, and blast diffusion boots. DPS 5 minute gem thresholds: These values are for referential purposes and assume you are using at least T90 weapons with T80 DPS armour. These thresholds apply to all combat styles, but they were written with magic in mind and they may differ slightly for melee and ranged. \u2022 Below 750k: Beginner. Your DPS is likely not good enough to deal with most higher end boss mechanics. Don't get discouraged if you're at this point; all it takes is practice and experience. \u2022 750k: Low. This is close to the highest point you can reach while still heavily relying on Revolution. At this point, you should consider learning to full manual. It may take while to get anywhere with it, but it is very rewarding in the end. \u2022 800k: Mid-low. While still not great DPS, it is likely good enough for casual kills at most end game bosses. \u2022 850k: Mid-high. A decent value, easily achievable by adding switches to a good base rotation. \u2022 900k: High. This requires a very solid rotation. Most end game PvMers sit at this value. You may want to consider upgrading your gear at this point if you're still at T90 weapons or T95 prayers. \u2022 950k: Very high. If you're here, it means you just need to iron out the finer details in your rotation to advance. \u2022 1000k+: Top-end. You're very well off. There's always room for improvement, but you're close to the damage cap. Courtesy of @269233963460067340 and thanks to Boss School! Learning Path 110k/120k DPM At this stage, it is likely that there's a fundamental lack of understanding regarding how to build a rotation, and when to perform certain abilities. We recommend starting out with this revolution bar below. Remember to use Sunshine when it's off cooldown (Ult once every minute), and use a ring of vigour switch and an adrenaline potion. It is extremely important to learn how to cancel channels at this stage. Otherwise your DPS will suffer greatly. An Example of Cancelled v. Uncancelled channeling (Snipe) Evil Lucario's guide on cancelling channels https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unCtj7IosVA 130k/140k DPM At this stage it is very important to learn a good ultimate rotation. It is encouraged in a 5 minute gem to do 5 Sunshines. Learning which thresholds to prioritize and use in an ultimate is extremely important to maximize your dpm. If you haven't already, you should get a planted feet switch in order to gain +8 seconds on your Sunshine. It is critical to focus on being able to fit in 6 thresholds in a Sunshine with an Adrenaline Potion, and 5 thresholds without an Adrenaline potion. Not having a planted feet switch will also cut your ultimates short by 1 threshold, generally speaking. Here it is also useful to start thinking about how strong certain abilities are by reading through the information in <#562827048914124800>. This section also assumes no Flanking Switches, which will be covered in the next section. Your threshold order in Sunshine should be: With no flanking OR Blast Diffusion Boots: Wild Magic \u2192 Asphyxiate \u2192 (Auto Attack + 100% Detonate + Dragon Breath stack) \u2192 Wild Magic \u2192 Asphyxiate 150k DPM At this stage, pushing to the next will almost certainly require the usage of a Planted Feet switch, as well as a Flanking switch. Start incorporating these switches if you haven't already. Once flanking can be used, the threshold prioritization in ultimates is as follows: With Flanking: Adrenaline Potion: Wild Magic \u2192 Asphyxiate \u2192 Deep Impact \u2192 Wild Magic \u2192 Asphyxiate \u2192 Deep Impact Without Adrenaline Potion: Wild Magic \u2192 Deep Impact \u2192 Asphyxiate \u2192 Wild Magic \u2192 Deep Impact With Blast Diffusion Boots: Adrenaline Potion: Wild Magic \u2192 Asphyxiate \u2192 3t 80% Detonate \u2192 Wild Magic \u2192 Asphyxiate \u2192 Deep Impact OR 3t 80% Detonate \u2192 Wild Magic \u2192 Deep Impact \u2192 Asphyxiate \u2192 Wild Magic \u2192 Deep Impact Without Adrenaline Potion: Wild Magic \u2192 3t 80% Detonate \u2192 Asphyxiate \u2192 Wild Magic \u2192 Deep Impact Additionally, there are two other techniques to learn at this stage: \u2022 Start your Sunshine with a planted feet wand, then quickly swap to your Staff and hit your auto attack before the GCD is over. This forces an 2h auto attack which deals an extra 1-4k damage each time you activate Sunshine. \u2022 Remember to use your flanking switch for impact basics. Using flanking on impact improves that ability from 100% ability damage to 220% ability damage and is often overlooked by inexperienced players. Furthermore, you may benefit from taking a look at a list of common mistakes made during combat/gems at this stage of dpm: <#622623001694699560>. It is very likely that by fixing a couple of these mistakes listed here, you will reach the next milestone of dpm. 160k DPM+ Once you're at 160k DPM, reaching higher levels of DPM will require either lots of min-max optimizations, luck (not worth focusing on), or incorporating weapon switches. Min-max optimizations refers to additional gear switches to squeeze out dps by just a hair. Items include asylum surgeon ring switch , dragon rider amulet switch, and a lunging switch. If you choose to go down this route, the idea is to equip an item momentarily for its effects, then unequip once you've used it. An example would be equipping Dragon Rider Amulet every time you dragonbreath for its chance of burn damage, then re-equipping Amulet of Souls (better stats) after you've used dragonbreath. At this point we encourage you to incorporate weapon switching to reach higher DPMs. Switching between 2h and DW will open up access to using both Sonic Wave (2h basic) and Concentrated Blast (DW basic) abilities \u2013 both have a 5 second cooldown and both are good damage at 157% ability damage. Link to a 4taa guide: https://youtu.be/HmZR1BBwsK0 by @162317885044293632 . 170/180k+ DPM Congratulations! This is about as far as you can go without weapon switching. If you would like to progress further up you will have to learn weapon switching. Assuming 4taa, here are some general tips and optimizations to make for furthering your DPM. \u2022 \u200e \u200eA strong sense of ability prioritization is the backbone of proficient 4taa. Since 4taa leads to slower ability usage, you should have more time to consider what ability to use next. Use this time to consider what is your next strongest ability. An exercise to help you here is to only use basics for a full minute of combat on a combat dummy. During this minute try your best at not using any abilities lower than 157% damage (Sonic or Conc should be your worst abilities). For the purposes of this exercise, pretend combust can be walked (even though dummies can't be walked). \u2022 Remember than you cannot auto attack after a channeled ability. This means that in your rhythm of Auto \u2013 Ability \u2013 Ability, your channeled ability should be the first ability between the two abilities. \u2022 Consider reorganizing your keybinds to make 4ting easier. This is for especially if you struggle with executing Auto Conc or Auto Asphyx . \u2022 Make sure your timing for Auto attack is correct. Inefficient 4t is a very detrimental to dps as you will be doing abilities slower AND you will be missing autos. Therefore it is very important to get the rhythm of 4t down and be able to consistently do 2h autos. As always, take a look through <#622623001694699560> for common mistakes. Even fixing one or two of these can have a siginicant impact on your dpm! 4 tick Auto Attack Guide The basic principles is you can do lossless spellcasting by hitting a spell from actionbar (lossless meaning you don't lose ticks performing the action). This lets you auto the same tick as you use an ability (input is auto \u2192 abil) When you can autoattack is based on a delay depending on your weapon speed: = 4t and = 6t Your delay after an action is given by max(currentdelay, delay from action) Implications from this are that if you do a wand ability you'll be able to autoattack 4 ticks after. If you do a staff ability, you will be able to autoattack 7 ticks after. A simple step-by-step practice rotation on how to 4 tick auto attack. Things you need: 1) Wand + Orb 2) Staff 3) Runes 4) The basic abilities Sonic Blast , Concentration blast , Wrack , and auto attack on your ability bar.

However, there's a catch. High damaging abilities often come with long cooldowns. If you use all of the high damaging abilities at once, you will be forced to wait for cooldowns before you may use them again \u2013 during which time you are forced to use low damage abilities. To circumvent this, the trick is to use 'filler abilities' \u2013 decent damage AND short cooldowns \u2013 in-between your high damaging abilities in order to pace your cooldowns. See this image for an idea of which abilities should be prioritized based on damage (in a vacuum) When building a rotation, ability prioritizations AND cooldowns should be on your mind. Filler abilities such as Sonic Wave and Concentrated Blast should be used in-between high damage abilities such as Dragon Breath , Corruption Blast , Impact-Flanking , and Combust-Walk . Any basic ability with damage lower than Sonic/Conc would be considered a weak ability (wrack , tuska , sacrifice , impact without flanking, chain on 1v1). If you are 2h or DW camping, you will be limited to only one filler ability (Sonic Wave or Concentrated Blast, respectively). Thus, try to utilize Sonic Wave or Concentrated Blast as often as possible in your rotation. A basic pattern of Sonic \u2192 Ability \u2192 Ability \u2192 Repeat is recommended for camping rotations. For weapon juggling, you will have access to both Sonic Wave and Concentrated Blast as filler abilities. This lets you have more breathing room in what rotations and fillers you create.

Min-max optimizations refers to additional gear switches to squeeze out dps by just a hair. Items include asylum surgeon ring switch , dragon rider amulet switch, and a lunging switch. If you choose to go down this route, the idea is to equip an item momentarily for its effects, then unequip once you've used it.

During this minute try your best at not using any abilities lower than 157% damage (Sonic or Conc should be your worst abilities). For the purposes of this exercise, pretend combust can be walked (even though dummies can't be walked). \u2022 Remember than you cannot auto attack after a channeled ability.

It takes time to learn full manual so stick with it! Overview - Melee DPS Compared to the other two combat styles, Melee is unique in that it is the only combat style that restricts you to a maximum range of 1-2 distance away from your target. As such, it is inherently more difficult to deal with certain boss mechanics at such a close range. The trade-off, and many players find this trade-off worth the disadvantages, is that Melee is unquestionably the highest DPS style of the three combat styles. Melee can reach a ceiling of 220k DPM whereas Mage and Range cap out at around 200k DPM. Melee is also unique in that to achieve such a high DPM benchmark a variety of weapon switches are needed - more so than the other styles. Since obtaining weapon switches is not a linear path (ie. players likely choose weapon switches based on cost), the progression path of melee makes less sense in DPM thresholds and more sense in terms of gradual incorporation of weapon switches. Having said that, PVME recommends upgrading your melee kit in this order (ordering is based off of most useful upgrade descending to the least useful upgrade - NOT based on cost). Melee Upgrade Order \u2022 Scythe AND/OR Drygores \u2022 Entry Level Perks \u2022 Malevolent Armour \u2022 Greater Barge \u2022 Greater Flurry \u2022 An off-hand Lunging 4 switch + Strength Skillcape \u2022 Biting 4 \u2022 An off-hand t90 Flanking 4 Switch. \u2022 Zaros Godsword \u2022 Malevolence \u2022 Masterwork Spear of Annihilation \u2022 Limitless \u2022 Khopesh of Tumeken \u2022 P6AS1 + AS4E2 (or P6R1 on 2h) \u2022 Laceration Boots \u2022 Custom Fitted Trimmed Masterwork \u2022 Khopesh of Elidinis \u200e \u200e \u200e \u2022 Greater Fury \u2022 SGB + IOTH \u2022 Hammer \u2022 Kalphite Defender \u2022 Upgrade to Flanking 4 Equilibrum 1 \u2022 Upgrade to T92 Flanking Switch Choosing a drygore It is recommended to use a Drygore Mace and either a Off-hand Drygore Longsword or Off-hand Drygore Rapier. Note that all Drygores have tier 90 ability damage, and if only using abilities, the choice of Drygores would make no difference. If considering auto attacks, maces have the fastest attack speed, and a lower auto attack damage, whereas longswords and rapiers have a slower attack speed for a slightly higher auto attack damage. The above combination of Drygores is optimal because you should never need mainhand autos, as 2h autos are always preferable, and the faster attack speeds allows for 5 tick auto attacking. However, when making use of freedom autos, then off-hand attack speed is considered. Camping a weapon Camping in this context refers to the exclusive usage of either DW or 2H without taking advantage of the benefits from switching. Most players will start learning melee by grabbing a 2h or DW and camping with said weapon. While you are limited to what rotations you can do while camping 2h or DW, it is still important to optimize with what you have. Your rotation will be generally built around either Lesser Fury or Greater Fury , depending on availability. High damage basics such as Cleave (2h exclusive), Decimate (DW exclusive), and Sever should be used as often as possible following Fury. Rotations will following a simple scheme as follows: Fury -> Ability -> Ability -> Repeat. The general idea is to build to your Berserk , and then within Berserk, use Assault , then either Destroy (DW) or Hurricane (2h), and then if you have the adrenaline to spare, use either Flurry (DW) or Quake (2h). 2h Build to 100% -> Berserk -> Assault -> Hurricane -> Quake -> Repeat DW Build to 100% -> Berserk -> Assault -> Destroy -> Flurry -> Repeat Note that for 1v1 situations, DW is more damage. In 1vMany situations, 2h deals more damage. Flanking 4 Flanking is a perk unlocked via Invention at level 55. The effect states Backhand, Impact and Binding Shot no longer stun and deal 40% more damage per rank to targets that are not facing you. Forceful Backhand, Deep Impact and Tight Bindings no longer stun and deal 15% more damage per rank to targets that are not facing you and goes up to rank 4. Should the opportunity arise at group bosses flanking can be incredibly powerful. Backhand becomes your 2nd most powerful basic inside of Berserk while Forceful Backhand becomes your 4th best threshold in Berserk. The basic ability Backhand should be used as often as possible and the threshold Forceful Backhand should be used either in Berserk or in-between Berserk cooldowns. Example rotations with Flanking: 2h Camping Berserk -> Assault -> Hurricane -> Forceful Backhand-Flanking -> Repeat DW Camping Berserk -> Assault -> Destroy -> Forceful Backhand-Flanking -> Repeat *Note that for DW, once you have Greater Flurry unlocked it should be used as your 3rd threshold inside Berserk. Flanking would be downgraded to a threshold used in-between Berserk cooldowns. This perk should be placed on a Dual Wield Off-hand switch and upgraded to your highest tier available (Drygore t90 or dyed-Khopesh t92). Example bosses to bring flanking to include: Vorago , Angel of Death , group ED1-3 , Solak , and any other group bossing. Lunging 4 Lunging is a perk unlocked via Invention at level 89. The effect states The maximum damage of Combust, Dismember and Fragmentation shot is incrased by 20% weapon damage per rank, but enemies that move will only take 1.5x increased damage. and goes up to rank 4. The only basic bleed in melee affected by Lunging is Dismember . Since Dismember cannot be walked to gain bonus damage, the effects of Lunging will always activate for Dismember, thus it is strictly an upgrade over non-lunging Dismember. In fact, the effect of Lunging is extra strong on Dismember because Dismember cannot be walked (the same applies to the 99 Strength Cape effect). With Lunging 4 and Strength Cape effect combined, Dismember becomes the strongest basic ability for melee outside of Berserk. Dismsmber should be used outside Berserk as bleeds do not get boosted damage (Dismember has a 15s cooldown so you should plan to use Dismember before a Berserk, then 20s later, use Dismember after a Berserk). The goal is to have 100% uptime of the Dismember effect when using Lunging4 + Strength Cape. A Dual Wield Off-hand switch should be used for this perk and later upgraded to a Masterwork Spear of Annihilation due to it further extending the duration of Dismember. DW and 2H weapon switching The biggest jump in DPM will come from incorporating weapon juggling of DW and 2h weapons. Having both weapon styles gives access to both DW Decimate and 2h Cleave basic abilities, each sporting a strong 188% ability damage and a low 7s cooldown. Even if you have to pair a high tier weapon with a lower tier weapon, the ability to access both Deci/Cleave is worth it (eg. Drygores with Dragon Rider Lance). With DW/2h Switching, it is possible to break beyond the 170k DPM barrier that Camping generally struggles to overcome. Example pairings of DW and 2h weapons: \u2022 t70 Abyssal Whip + Enhanced Excalibur \u2022 t80 Avaryss and Nymora Blades \u2022 t90 Elder Rune \u2022 t90 Drygores \u2022 t92 Khopeshes \u2022 t70 Any GWD1 Godsword \u2022 t80 Dragon Rider Lance \u2022 t90 Noxious Scythe \u2022 t92 Zaros Godsword Here we will abandon camping rotations built around Fury Fury -> Basic -> Basic -> Repeat. Your new DW/2h rotations will be built around Decimate and Cleave Deci -> Cleave -> Ability -> Ability -> Repeat. OR Cleave -> Deci -> Ability -> Ability -> Repeat. Substitute 'Ability' with other strong basic abilities such as Dismember , Sever , Fury , Backhand-Flanking , etc. We use Deci/Cleave as often as possible as they each have a 7s cooldown and deal great damage at 188% ability damage. Berserk Rotations will also change once you begin DW/2h switching: With Adrenaline Pot Berserk -> Assault -> Destroy -> Forceful Backhand OR Berserk -> Assault -> Destroy -> Greater Flurry Without Adrenaline Pot Berserk -> Assault -> Hurricane -> Forceful Backhand OR Berserk -> Assault -> Hurricane -> Greater Flurry Note: use Greater Flurry over Forceful Backhand-Flanking if you have it available It may be useful to start thinking about how strong certain abilities are by reading through the information in <#562827048914124800>. 2h vs DW assault Assault hit splats will land at different times depending on whether it is cast with 2h or DW. The timing to cancel it remains unchanged. 2 4 6 8 for 2h 3 5 7 9 for dw Auto Attacks Once you've incorporated DW/2h Switching, auto attacks become more prevelant as a dps tool. When you can auto attack is based on a delay depending on your weapon speed: DW = 4t, 2h = 6t. We will be using 2h auto attacks as they deal more damage. There are two specific instances of when you want to incorporate auto attacks into your rotation; one is 'passive', the other will is 5taa. 'Passive' auto attacks By performing a non-damaging ability with DW equipped, the auto attack cooldown is initiated and begins counting down; 5t cooldown, a GCD is 3t. After GCD, waiting an additional 2t would mean your auto attack becomes available again. By swapping to a 2h, an auto attack can be used by clicking on your target (click BEFORE inputting an ability). Auto attacks can deal up to 5k damage, 8k in a Berserk and in most cases is worth the 2t wait. Thus, you can perform an auto attack on every Berserk activation by doing the following: Equip DW -> Berserk -> Swap to 2h and wait 2t -> Click target (Auto Attack) -> Continue with Zerk rotation Note: This technique becomes more prevelant with the introduction of Greater Barge, which is discussed later in this channel. Note: I call this section 'passive' auto attacks as they can be weaved relatively passively into your normal rotation. I would call this section 'loseless' though that is not technically true. 5taa Auto attacks can be used 'actively' in what's known as 5taa. Similar to mage, the idea is to use a 2h auto attack every other ability, in a pattern of: Auto Attack -> Ability1 -> Ability2 -> Repeat. https://youtu.be/9cwMPBt6mg0 Ability2 must be a DW ability and must not be a channeled ability. Input Ability1 as soon as you see the sword swing animation from the Auto attack. Timing will take practice. There are no restrictions on what Ability1 can be. This rotation has a similar damage output compared to the Deci/Cleave rotation and is situationally utilized when you run out of 'good' abilities. Remember, Auto attacks are not abilities so they are always available. There are two major downsides of 5taa to consider: 1) Slower adrenaline gain: Melee 2h Autos only give 3% adrenaline. Since you are doing an auto every other ability, coupled with standing idle for 2 ticks every other ability, you gain adrenaline at a much slower pace than with traditional rotations. 2) There is no button to force melee auto attacks. This means you have to stand idle for 2 ticks after Ability2 and wait for the auto attack to come out, before inputting your next ability. Proper timing will require practice. Input an ability too fast and you lose the Auto attack. Input an ability too slow and you lose DPS. These two reasons are why 5taa is a situational technique though it is still worth mentioning. Deviating Upgrade Paths The prioritization of upgrades can vary depending on what your focus is with PvM. The remaining upgrades are also very expensive, varying from 100m to 1b. If you will be primarily doing Vorago or Solak, it is recommended to pick up a Greater Barge codex . Its special affect allows you to turn channeled abilities into bleeds. If you're more interested in bosses such as Angel of Death, Raids - Beastmaster & Yakamaru, or faster kills at Araxxor, it is recommended to buy a Zaros Godsword. Its extremely powerful special attack greatly improves your sustained DPM. At high defense bosses such as Vorago, Angel of Death, and Raids - Beastmaster & Yakamaru, it is recommended to pick up a Statius' Warhammer. It has a special attack which significantly lowers defences for 1 minute. In the end you should aim to grab all three of these upgrades. Zaros Godsword The Zaros Godsword is a T92 2H melee weapon noteworthy for its powerful Special Attack 'Blackhole'. Blackhole is a DPS buff - essentially a Sunshine or Death's Swiftness for melee - which uses 50% Adrenaline (45% with Vigour ), buffs damage by 20% and lasts for 20 seconds. It should be used in rotation with Berserk (ie. use Blackhole when Berserk is on cooldown) OR when the situation is too dangerous to Berserk in. ZGS rotations are similar to Berserk rotations but vary based on the boss. Note that you do not need to keep ZGS equipped once you've activated its special attack. Also note that ZGS does not have scythe range. As for adrenaline potions, it is recommended to save adrenaline potions for Berserk as it is more valuable in Berserk with its higher damage modifier. Berserk + Adrenaline Potion / Limitless Sigil \u2192 Berserk Cooldown \u2192 ZGS Special \u2192 ZGS Cooldown \u2192 Repeat Statius' Warhammer One of the more powerful aspects of melee in group pvm is access to the SWH special attack without the need for an Ingenuity of the Humans ability . If you intend to do group PvM it is recommended to buy a SWH and use its special attack at high defence bosses (eg. Vorago, Yakamaru, Beast Master, Angel of Death). Usage of the SWH varies from boss to boss and will be covered more specifically in our boss guides. Greater Barge Greater Barge can be unlocked through consuming a Greater Barge Ability Codex and transforms your lesser Barge ability to Greater Barge. The description of Greater Barge is as follows: Greater barge requires the player to stop attacking their target for 3 seconds (5 ticks, roughly 2 GCD). At this point, the greater barge icon will show up on your buff bar. This indicates that the gbarge buff is ready to be activated. Barge your target, and a Provoke icon will appear on your buff bar with a 10 tick (roughly 3 GCD) timer. At any point during these 10 ticks any channeled ability you cast will become a damage-over-time bleed instead. https://youtu.be/GPPMjY2wrjw This effect is EXTREMELY powerful and can create lots of burst DPS. It is also extremely useful in any scenarios where you are forced to stop attacking due to a mechanic (eg. reflecting Web at Araxxor, phasing at Yakamaru pools, reflects at Vorago, phasing at Solak, etc) as these downtimes allow for Greater Barge to proc its waiting initial effect. The applications of this are explored moreso in our specific boss guides but generally it is used as follows: Wait 5 ticks to proc Greater Barge -> Barge Target -> Activate channeled threshold (eg. Assault , Destroy , or Greater Flurry ) -> Continue DPS rotation within next GCD. Greater Barge is also often used in tandom with Berserk and Greater Flurry for even more burst DPS. Starting the rotation at 92% adrenaline: Anticipate -> Berserk -> gBarge -> Greater Flurry (bleed) -> Continue with DPS Using greater flurry as gBarge's bleed will allow its full duration to take effect thereby lowering Berserk's cooldown. In this rotation, Anticipate can be replaced with Resonance if you think you will have a hard time surviving after you Berserk. Notes on gBarge The 'bleed' from gBarge is not a true bleed. There are several ramifications of this: \u200e \u200e1) Multiple people can stack a gBarge 'bleed' on the same target and they will not override each other. \u200e \u200e2) Equipping a different tier weapon after you apply the bleed will change the bleed's damage according to the latter weapon tier. For example, if you apply the gBarge bleed with Drygores (t90) equipped, then switch to ZGS (t92) the damage will be calculated as a t92 weapon. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e2.1) If the initial weapon has a special effect against a target, the effect can activate after you switch to another weapon. For example, apply a gBarge bleed with Terrasaur Maul then switching to Khopeshes will apply its special buff against Ranged monsters during its bleed calculations, to give T92 + 12.5% damage, rather than T80 + 12.5%. \u200e \u200e3) During Yakamaru's Stun Pool, mbarging a Destroy ability will still apply its stun effect for the entire 4 hits. This can be a costly mistake. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e3.1) Akin to note 2, switching to a flanking weapon during the gBarge bleed effect will null the stun effect. \u200e \u200e4) Normally Vorago will clear bleeds at the start of its Reflect mechanic. Since gBarge is not a true bleed, it will not clear the bleed effect. This makes it very easy to PK teammates if you have miscounted auto attacks. Use with caution at Vorago. \u200e \u200e5) There is currently a glitch that prevents the gBarge bleed effect from procing, despite having been outside of combat for the required duration. It is currently thought to be caused by being out of combat for 10 seconds with no target, then re-entering combat with gBarge, though the causes of this glitch is still unclear. Greater Fury Greater Fury can be unlocked through consuming a Greater Fury Ability Codex. This does two things: 1) Fury is no longer a channeled ability and instead only hits once dealing 157% ability damage, and 2) gains an extra effect where getting a critical hit with Fury will guarentee your next hit to be a crit as well. The main benefit to this upgrade is transforming this ability from a channeled ability to a gcd ability. This allows fury to be used in revo++ and revolution set ups without needing a manual input to cancel on gcd. The crit effect can also be beneficial to overall DPS though it is random. Greater Flurry Greater Flurry can be unlocked through consuming a Greater Flurry Ability Codex. The effect states: Perform a flurry of blows against your surrounding targets, dealing up to 94% weapon damage per hit over 3.6 seconds. If only one target is nearby, up to 157% weapon damage per hit will be dealt instead. Additionally if an attack hits any target per swing, the cooldown of Berserk will be reduced by 1.2 seconds each swing. Once you've unlocked this threshold, it becomes your 3rd best threshold in Berserk. In addition, its unique effect of reducing Berserk cooldown is very useful in overall Melee rotations. There are several ways of using GFlurry. You can either cancel it on GCD (ie. 2 hits) for burst damage, or use it for its entire duration for its Berserk reduction effect. If you bleed this threshold using gBarge, all bleed hits will contribute towards reducing Berserk's cooldown. This is used extensively at Aod and Solak where players want to Berserk as often as possible through out the fight. Remaining Upgrades At this stage, all important upgrades have been obtained and all that remains is to get inherent DPM boosting upgrades. Following this, buy either Khopeshes or a T99 Codex, depending on which one is cheaper. Then it is encouraged to start picking up things such as Trimmed Masterwork (which is very useful due to its set effect, and can save your ass at times), and dyed Lunging or Flanking switches.

Most players start by letting revolution activate basics while they manually input thresholds and ultimates. The next step would be to manually activate basic abilities too, with revolution still active as a failsafe. Once you feel confident in activating basic abilities manually, try turning off revolution. An exercise to help you here is to only use basics for a full minute of combat on a combat dummy. Your goal is to not lose any ticks between basic abilities, either due to cooldowns or due to not manually activating the next ability fast enough.

Having both weapon styles gives access to both DW Decimate and 2h Cleave basic abilities, each sporting a strong 188% ability damage and a low 7s cooldown. Even if you have to pair a high tier weapon with a lower tier weapon, the ability to access both Deci/Cleave is worth it (eg. Drygores with Dragon Rider Lance).

When you can auto attack is based on a delay depending on your weapon speed: DW = 4t, 2h = 6t. We will be using 2h auto attacks as they deal more damage. There are two specific instances of when you want to incorporate auto attacks into your rotation; one is 'passive', the other will is 5taa. 'Passive' auto attacks By performing a non-damaging ability with DW equipped, the auto attack cooldown is initiated and begins counting down; 5t cooldown, a GCD is 3t. After GCD, waiting an additional 2t would mean your auto attack becomes available again. By swapping to a 2h, an auto attack can be used by clicking on your target (click BEFORE inputting an ability). Auto attacks can deal up to 5k damage, 8k in a Berserk and in most cases is worth the 2t wait. Thus, you can perform an auto attack on every Berserk activation by doing the following: Equip DW -> Berserk -> Swap to 2h and wait 2t -> Click target (Auto Attack) -> Continue with Zerk rotation Note: This technique becomes more prevelant with the introduction of Greater Barge, which is discussed later in this channel. Note: I call this section 'passive' auto attacks as they can be weaved relatively passively into your normal rotation. I would call this section 'loseless' though that is not technically true.","title":"Auto Attacks"},{"location":"pvme-guides/dpm-advice/dpm-advice-melee/#5taa","text":"Auto attacks can be used 'actively' in what's known as 5taa. Similar to mage, the idea is to use a 2h auto attack every other ability, in a pattern of: Auto Attack -> Ability1 -> Ability2 -> Repeat. https://youtu.be/9cwMPBt6mg0 Ability2 must be a DW ability and must not be a channeled ability. Input Ability1 as soon as you see the sword swing animation from the Auto attack. Timing will take practice. There are no restrictions on what Ability1 can be. This rotation has a similar damage output compared to the Deci/Cleave rotation and is situationally utilized when you run out of 'good' abilities. Remember, Auto attacks are not abilities so they are always available. There are two major downsides of 5taa to consider: 1) Slower adrenaline gain: Melee 2h Autos only give 3% adrenaline. Since you are doing an auto every other ability, coupled with standing idle for 2 ticks every other ability, you gain adrenaline at a much slower pace than with traditional rotations. 2) There is no button to force melee auto attacks. This means you have to stand idle for 2 ticks after Ability2 and wait for the auto attack to come out, before inputting your next ability. Proper timing will require practice. Input an ability too fast and you lose the Auto attack. Input an ability too slow and you lose DPS. These two reasons are why 5taa is a situational technique though it is still worth mentioning.","title":"5taa"},{"location":"pvme-guides/dpm-advice/dpm-advice-melee/#deviating-upgrade-paths","text":"The prioritization of upgrades can vary depending on what your focus is with PvM. The remaining upgrades are also very expensive, varying from 100m to 1b. If you will be primarily doing Vorago or Solak, it is recommended to pick up a Greater Barge codex . Its special affect allows you to turn channeled abilities into bleeds. If you're more interested in bosses such as Angel of Death, Raids - Beastmaster & Yakamaru, or faster kills at Araxxor, it is recommended to buy a Zaros Godsword. Its extremely powerful special attack greatly improves your sustained DPM. At high defense bosses such as Vorago, Angel of Death, and Raids - Beastmaster & Yakamaru, it is recommended to pick up a Statius' Warhammer. It has a special attack which significantly lowers defences for 1 minute. In the end you should aim to grab all three of these upgrades. Zaros Godsword The Zaros Godsword is a T92 2H melee weapon noteworthy for its powerful Special Attack 'Blackhole'. Blackhole is a DPS buff - essentially a Sunshine or Death's Swiftness for melee - which uses 50% Adrenaline (45% with Vigour ), buffs damage by 20% and lasts for 20 seconds. It should be used in rotation with Berserk (ie. use Blackhole when Berserk is on cooldown) OR when the situation is too dangerous to Berserk in. ZGS rotations are similar to Berserk rotations but vary based on the boss. Note that you do not need to keep ZGS equipped once you've activated its special attack. Also note that ZGS does not have scythe range. As for adrenaline potions, it is recommended to save adrenaline potions for Berserk as it is more valuable in Berserk with its higher damage modifier. Berserk + Adrenaline Potion / Limitless Sigil \u2192 Berserk Cooldown \u2192 ZGS Special \u2192 ZGS Cooldown \u2192 Repeat Statius' Warhammer One of the more powerful aspects of melee in group pvm is access to the SWH special attack without the need for an Ingenuity of the Humans ability . If you intend to do group PvM it is recommended to buy a SWH and use its special attack at high defence bosses (eg. Vorago, Yakamaru, Beast Master, Angel of Death). Usage of the SWH varies from boss to boss and will be covered more specifically in our boss guides. Greater Barge Greater Barge can be unlocked through consuming a Greater Barge Ability Codex and transforms your lesser Barge ability to Greater Barge. The description of Greater Barge is as follows: Greater barge requires the player to stop attacking their target for 3 seconds (5 ticks, roughly 2 GCD). At this point, the greater barge icon will show up on your buff bar. This indicates that the gbarge buff is ready to be activated. Barge your target, and a Provoke icon will appear on your buff bar with a 10 tick (roughly 3 GCD) timer. At any point during these 10 ticks any channeled ability you cast will become a damage-over-time bleed instead. https://youtu.be/GPPMjY2wrjw This effect is EXTREMELY powerful and can create lots of burst DPS. It is also extremely useful in any scenarios where you are forced to stop attacking due to a mechanic (eg. reflecting Web at Araxxor, phasing at Yakamaru pools, reflects at Vorago, phasing at Solak, etc) as these downtimes allow for Greater Barge to proc its waiting initial effect. The applications of this are explored moreso in our specific boss guides but generally it is used as follows: Wait 5 ticks to proc Greater Barge -> Barge Target -> Activate channeled threshold (eg. Assault , Destroy , or Greater Flurry ) -> Continue DPS rotation within next GCD. Greater Barge is also often used in tandom with Berserk and Greater Flurry for even more burst DPS. Starting the rotation at 92% adrenaline: Anticipate -> Berserk -> gBarge -> Greater Flurry (bleed) -> Continue with DPS Using greater flurry as gBarge's bleed will allow its full duration to take effect thereby lowering Berserk's cooldown. In this rotation, Anticipate can be replaced with Resonance if you think you will have a hard time surviving after you Berserk. Notes on gBarge The 'bleed' from gBarge is not a true bleed. There are several ramifications of this: \u200e \u200e1) Multiple people can stack a gBarge 'bleed' on the same target and they will not override each other. \u200e \u200e2) Equipping a different tier weapon after you apply the bleed will change the bleed's damage according to the latter weapon tier. For example, if you apply the gBarge bleed with Drygores (t90) equipped, then switch to ZGS (t92) the damage will be calculated as a t92 weapon. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e2.1) If the initial weapon has a special effect against a target, the effect can activate after you switch to another weapon. For example, apply a gBarge bleed with Terrasaur Maul then switching to Khopeshes will apply its special buff against Ranged monsters during its bleed calculations, to give T92 + 12.5% damage, rather than T80 + 12.5%. \u200e \u200e3) During Yakamaru's Stun Pool, mbarging a Destroy ability will still apply its stun effect for the entire 4 hits. This can be a costly mistake. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e3.1) Akin to note 2, switching to a flanking weapon during the gBarge bleed effect will null the stun effect. \u200e \u200e4) Normally Vorago will clear bleeds at the start of its Reflect mechanic. Since gBarge is not a true bleed, it will not clear the bleed effect. This makes it very easy to PK teammates if you have miscounted auto attacks. Use with caution at Vorago. \u200e \u200e5) There is currently a glitch that prevents the gBarge bleed effect from procing, despite having been outside of combat for the required duration. It is currently thought to be caused by being out of combat for 10 seconds with no target, then re-entering combat with gBarge, though the causes of this glitch is still unclear. Greater Fury Greater Fury can be unlocked through consuming a Greater Fury Ability Codex. This does two things: 1) Fury is no longer a channeled ability and instead only hits once dealing 157% ability damage, and 2) gains an extra effect where getting a critical hit with Fury will guarentee your next hit to be a crit as well. The main benefit to this upgrade is transforming this ability from a channeled ability to a gcd ability. This allows fury to be used in revo++ and revolution set ups without needing a manual input to cancel on gcd. The crit effect can also be beneficial to overall DPS though it is random. Greater Flurry Greater Flurry can be unlocked through consuming a Greater Flurry Ability Codex. The effect states: Perform a flurry of blows against your surrounding targets, dealing up to 94% weapon damage per hit over 3.6 seconds. If only one target is nearby, up to 157% weapon damage per hit will be dealt instead. Additionally if an attack hits any target per swing, the cooldown of Berserk will be reduced by 1.2 seconds each swing. Once you've unlocked this threshold, it becomes your 3rd best threshold in Berserk. In addition, its unique effect of reducing Berserk cooldown is very useful in overall Melee rotations. There are several ways of using GFlurry. You can either cancel it on GCD (ie. 2 hits) for burst damage, or use it for its entire duration for its Berserk reduction effect. If you bleed this threshold using gBarge, all bleed hits will contribute towards reducing Berserk's cooldown. This is used extensively at Aod and Solak where players want to Berserk as often as possible through out the fight.","title":"Deviating Upgrade Paths"},{"location":"pvme-guides/dpm-advice/dpm-advice-melee/#remaining-upgrades","text":"At this stage, all important upgrades have been obtained and all that remains is to get inherent DPM boosting upgrades.

While we do not encourage using Revo++ as it limits the amount of control a player has over their own rotation, it is low-input and low maintenance. Revo++ can be desirable for afking, low-effort pvm, or slayer tasks. Here is an ability bar we recommend for Revo++. Using this recommended ability bar with zero player input you can achieve a DPM of roughly 130k. To toggle on revolution++ and highlight how many abilities to trigger with it, click the clog icon on your ability bar: Revolution Revolution (not revo++) is a combat mode wherein basic abilities are used automatically by the game but threshold and ultimate abilities are manually activated. Newer players may find this combat mode helpful starting out as it allows for some control over your rotation but doesn't overburden you with managing basic abilities. Below is an ability bar we recommend to use for revolution. Note that the thresholds and ultimate abilities can be placed in any order as it does not matter where they are on the bar \u2014 you will be manually activating them. If you are new to using revolution, simply let revo use basic abilities for you. Activate Death Swiftness once you reach 100% adrenaline. From there use your thresholds whenever you reach 50% adrenaline (snapshot, rapid fire, tendrils, etc). Repeat. Following this simple repeating pattern of Build to 100% -> Death Swiftness - > Thresholds -> Repeat , one can expect to reach around 150k dpm with low-medium player input. Full Manual Full Manual is a combat mode wherein all abilities are manually activated by the player. No automatic inputs from the game means no damaging abilities will be done, therefore this mode requires high input from the player. The benefit of this mode is that it allows for the greatest degree of control over which abilities are used in any given scenario. Most high level pvmers opt to use this combat mode. While it does not matter where you place your abilities on your bar with full manual, you may still find it helpful to organize your bar based on basics to thresholds to ultimate. Refer to the revolution bars as examples. Transitioning from revo to full manual can seem intimidating but all it takes is practice. Most players start by letting revolution activate basics while they manually input thresholds and ultimates. The next step would be to manually activate basic abilities too, with revolution still active as a failsafe. Once you feel confident in activating basic abilities manually, try turning off revolution. An exercise to help you here is to only use basics for a full minute of combat on a combat dummy. Your goal is to not lose any ticks between basic abilities, either due to cooldowns or due to not manually activating the next ability fast enough. Once you get comfortable at a combat dummy, try on a real boss such as GWD1 (Graador/Kr'il/Kree) or GWD2 (Vindicta). There is no easy \"trick\" to skip past the practice. It takes time to learn full manual so stick with it! Ability Prioritizations & Building a Rotation Generally speaking, high damaging abilities should be prioritized and used more often than low damaging abilities. However, there's a catch. High damaging abilities often come with long cooldowns. If you use all of the high damaging abilities at once, you will be forced to wait for cooldowns before you may use them again - during which time you are forced to use low damage abilities. To circumvent this, the trick is to use 'filler abilities' - decent damage AND short cooldowns - in-between your high damaging abilities in order to pace your cooldowns. See this image for an idea of which abilities should be prioritized based on damage (in a vacuum) When building a rotation, ability prioritizations AND cooldowns should be on your mind. Filler abilities such as Needle Strike and Dazing Shot should be used in-between high damage abilities such as Snipe , Corruption Shot , Binding Shot-Flanking , and Fragmentation Shot-Walk . Any basic ability with damage lower than Needle/Dazing would be considered a weak ability (Piercing , tuska , sacrifice , binding shot without flanking, richochet on 1v1). If you are 2h or DW camping you will be limited to only one filler ability (Dazing Shot or Needle Strike, respectively. Thus, try to utilize Dazing or Needle as often as possible in your rotations. A basic pattern of Needle -> Ability -> Ability -> Repeat is recommended for camping rotations. For weapon juggling, you will have access to both Needle and Dazing as filler abilities. This lets you have more breathing room in what rotations and fillers you create. Measuring DPM - Challenge Gems and Runemetrics A good way to get an understand of where you are in terms of DPM is by placing a challenge gem at Combat Academy at Lumbridge and doing a 5 minute gem. Use your best armor, weapon, supreme or elder overloads, and the best DPS prayers you have available. After 5 minutes, divide your score by 5 to figure out your DPM. For example, a 750,000 score on a gem means 150k DPM. \u200e \u200eFrom here, it becomes easier to understand where your focus should lie as you progress up the DPM ladder. You may also use Runemetrics to measure your DPM. Simply set the mode to stopwatch on the Runemetrics tab and after 5 minutes of combat stop to evaluate your score. Rules for a 5 minute challenge gem at dummies: \u2022 Dummy must be in normal mode \u2022 0% adrenaline start \u2022 No aura \u2022 No Vulnerability \u2022 No familiar/dreadnips \u2022 No weapon poison or Cinderbanes \u2022 No active pocket slot item \u2022 No ruby bakriminel bolts \u2022 No Amulet of Zealots \u2022 AoE damage will be subtracted Here's an example of what should be brought to DPM practice with challenge gems. Your best gear for the style being used, adrenaline or replenishment potions, overloads, and ring of vigour. Other items to consider bringing if you have them are: planted feet switch, flanking switch, lunging switch, and powerburst of overkill. DPS 5 minute gem thresholds: These values are for referential purposes and assume you are using at least T90 weapons with T80 DPS armour. These thresholds apply to all combat styles, but they were written with magic in mind and they may differ slightly for melee and ranged. \u2022 Below 750k: Beginner. Your DPS is likely not good enough to deal with most higher end boss mechanics. Don't get discouraged if you're at this point; all it takes is practice and experience. \u2022 750k: Low. This is close to the highest point you can reach while still heavily relying on Revolution. At this point, you should consider learning to full manual. It may take while to get anywhere with it, but it is very rewarding in the end. \u2022 800k: Mid-low. While still not great DPS, it is likely good enough for casual kills at most end game bosses. \u2022 850k: Mid-high. A decent value, easily achievable by adding switches to a good base rotation. \u2022 900k: High. This requires a very solid rotation. Most end game PvMers sit at this value. You may want to consider upgrading your gear at this point if you're still at t90s/t95s. \u2022 950k: Very high. If you're here, it means you just need to iron out the finer details in your rotation to advance. \u2022 1000k+: Top-end. You're very well off. There's always room for improvement, but you're close to the damage cap. Courtesy of @269233963460067340 and thanks to Boss School! Bakriminel Bolts Enchanted bakriminel bolts provide various effects which can be very useful in certain pvm scenarios. If you are using DW weapons it is highly recommended that you use bakriminel bolts for increased DPM. Here's a rundown of the current meta. If a bolt does not appear on this list, it is not considered meta . Ruby bolts - Overall best dps bolt for general pvm. 5% chance to activate, replacing a hit with a new one based on target's HP. The bolts have a shared cooldown per target, making them less effective (but still very powerful) in groups. Around ~70k HP, it is recommended to switch to another type of bolt, as ruby bolts can reduce DPS if the bolt damage is less than the original hit. Diamond bolts - Improves accuracy. Useful for bosses where you want the extra accuracy above all else (eg. Rise of the Six). Onyx bolts - 10% chance to activate, heals 25% of the hit that triggered activation. Also increases damage by 25% on activation. Great for sustained healing, and alternative bolts after ruby bolts are no longer effective. Expensive. Hydrix bolts - 10% chance to activate, immediately granting 10% adren, and +1% on basics for 15 seconds. Used as a utility bolt for pumping out more thresholds while in Death's Swiftness. These are the hardest bolts to use effectively as they require you to improvise a rotation based off of how much adrenaline you gain . Very expensive. Note: Ruby bak bolts are banned from challenge gems as its difficult accurately measure your DPM with their effects. Learning Path 110k/120k DPM At this stage, it is likely that there's a fundamental lack of understanding regarding how to build a rotation, and when to perform certain abilities. Starting out, it's recommended to use the following Revolution bar. Remember to use Death's Swiftness when it is off cooldown (Ult once every minute), and use a ring of vigour switch and an adrenaline potion . It is extremely important to learn how to cancel channels at this stage. Otherwise your DPS will suffer greatly. Revolution bar An Example of Cancelled v. Uncancelled channeling (Snipe) Evil Lucario's guide on cancelling channels https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unCtj7IosVA 130k/140k DPM At this stage it is very important to learn a good ultimate rotation. It is encouraged in a 5 minute gem to do 5 Death's Swiftness. Learning which thresholds to prioritize and use in an ultimate is extremely important to maximize your dpm. If you haven't already, you should get a planted feet switch in order to gain +8 seconds on your Death's Swiftness. It is critical to focus on being able to fit in 6 thresholds in a Swiftness with an Adrenaline Potion, and 5 thresholds without an Adrenaline potion. Not having a planted feet switch will also cut your ultimates short by 1 threshold, generally speaking. It is also useful to start thinking about how strong certain abilities are by reading through the information in <#562827048914124800>. This section also assumes no Flanking Switches, which will be covered in the next section. Your threshold order in Death's Swiftness should be: With Adrenaline Potion: Rapid Fire > Snapshot > Shadow Tendrils > Rapid Fire > Bombardment > Snapshot OR Snapshot > Rapid Fire > Shadow Tendrils > Bombardment > Snapshot > Rapid Fire Without Adrenaline Potion: Snapshot > Shadow Tendrils > Rapid Fire > Snapshot > Bombardment 150k DPM At this stage, pushing to the next will almost certainly require the usage of a Planted Feet switch, as well as a Flanking switch. Start incorporating these switches if you haven't already. Once flanking can be used, the threshold prioritization in ultimates is as follows: With Adrenaline Potion: Snapshot \u200e \u200e> Rapid Fire > Shadow Tendrils > Tight Bindings > Snapshot > Rapid Fire OR Rapid Fire > Snapshot > Shadow Tendrils > Rapid Fire > Tight Bindings > Snapshot Without Adrenaline Potion: Snapshot > Shadow Tendrils > Rapid Fire > Snapshot > Tight Bindings Two notes: We remove Bombardment from our threshold rotations as they are all replaced with Flanking. Remember to use your flanking switch for basics, not just for thresholds. Using flanking on Binding Shot improves that ability from 100% ability damage to 220% ability damage and is often overlooked by inexperienced players. Furthermore, you may benefit from taking a look at a list of common mistakes made during combat/gems at this stage of dpm: <#622623001694699560>. It is very likely that by fixing a couple of these mistakes listed here, you will reach the next milestone of dpm. 160k DPM Once you're at 160k DPM, reaching higher levels of DPM will require either lots of min-max optimizations, lots of luck (not worth focusing on), or incorporating weapon switching. Assuming you have been DW camping until this point, obtaining an SGB or a Decimation bow will allow you to DW/2H switch without switching ammo. Start focusing on never using an ability worse than 157% ability damage. Any Tuska's or Sacrifice in your rotation should be swapped for a Dazing Shot. Maintain the same threshold order in Death's Swiftness and remember to needle strike before snapshot and shadow tendrils for higher damage. From this point onwards we will also incorporate ways to force auto attacks. For Death's Swiftness, using a DW MH for planted feet then switching to 2H will also force an auto attack, which can contribute significant damage. Sometimes clicking your target is necessary to force the auto attack. The sequence of actions goes as follows: Equip DW PF -> Activate Death's Swiftness -> Equip 2h within GCD -> Click target (auto attack will come out here) -> Activate Ability Using Shadow Tendrils with 2H after using a DW ability with a 'fastest' speed weapon allows for stacking an auto on top of the tendrils. From this point onwards reaching higher DPM benchmarks will require a strong understanding of basic prioritization, cooldowns, and adrenaline management. As such, it is entirely practice and receiving feedback. Familiarizing yourself with ability prioritizations will be invaluable at this stage. 170/180k+ DPM Congratulations! This is about as far as you can go without weapon switching. If you would like to progress further up you will have to learn weapon switching. From here the next progression leads to bakriminel bolt switching. Various bak bolts provide a variety of effects which can be useful under different circumstances (see the Bakriminel bolts section for more info). Since most bak bolts have an innate cooldown, we can bypass any downtime by switching between 2-3 bolts to get the most out of their effects at any given time. Bolt switches are usually done between the four meta bolts: Ruby, Diamond, Onyx, and Hydrix. The idea is to pick two or three bolts for a given scenario to minimize downtime between bolt cooldowns and to maximize their effects. For example, the most effective bolt when fighting <#534612663523737619> are Ruby bolts as they are the best dps bolts. However, when attacking minions the most effective bolt becomes Hydrix as minions have a soft hitcap of 1000 so any Ruby procs are wasted. During the last phase, the most effective bolt on Nex becomes Onyx as she is lower than 100k hp thus reducing Ruby's effectiveness. As a general rule: pick Ruby for DPS; pick Diamond for accuracy; pick Onyx for healing; pick Hydrix for adrenaline gain. Mix and match to gain the most out of all of these bolts in a boss fight!

These tricks are generally meant for people with a very strong understanding of the combat system in RuneScape, and are encouraged only in cases where you're hovering at the 160-170k DPM threshold. 3t Snipe This technique allows using Snipe in 3 ticks as opposed to its intended 4 tick duration. It will still hit at the same time as it normally would. Needless to say being able to use Snipe as a non-channeled ability (within a GCD) is very strong and is useful everywhere though the major drawback is this method requires ability queing to be enabled. Players may find queing difficult to use so use at your own discretion. \u200e \u200e \u2022 Method requires Ability Queuing to be turned ON. \u2022 Method requires Nightmare Gauntlets to be equipped. Simply use Snipe, then queue up any other ability prior to GCD. For example: Snipe -> Queue piercing shot . This will cause Piercing shot to come out on the following GCD after Snipe instead of having to wait 4 ticks for the full channel of Snipe. After you fire the queued ability off your character will be rooted in place for 1 tick. Demonstration: http://youtu.be/bd64iILPqJM 10 Second Needle Strike Buff This technique allows you to retain the Needle Strike's 7% damage bonus buff for 10 seconds. \u2022 Requires 2 targets in order to work, normally a boss mob/dummy and then the boss itself \u2022 Needle striking the 1st target (dummy/boss mob) and then targeting the 2nd target (the boss) and ammo swapping/mainhand swapping essentially allows the needle buff to persist past just the first attack you deal, instead it will last for 17 ticks meaning any non bleed ranged damage you deal for the next 17 ticks on that target will have the 7% needle buff. \u2022 Dealing damage to the target you originally needle striked will cancel the 10 second buff \u2022 If you do not swap mainhands or ammo after needle striking the first target you will get no buff at all until you do so, the timer begins as soon as you needle the first target \u2022 If you switch targets before needle hits you don't have to switch mh or bolts, but if needle hits before you switch targets then you need to switch mh or bolts. \u2022 Useful for places like vorago p3s/p5s where you would have a dummy down and needle strike it prior to releasing thresholds on vorago, can also be used at AoD by needle striking reaver/pillars/amalgs \u2022 Can see that the entire rapidfire has the needle strike buff instead of just the first two hits, the following 3 abilities after the rapidfire would also have the needle strike buff as well Demonstration: https://youtu.be/k_IxIyoZFww Weapon override delaying/speeding up abilities Certain weapon types for ranged can cause abilities that normally take 2 ticks to deal damage to only take 1 tick to deal damage depending on your distance from your target.

While it does not matter where you place your abilities on your bar with full manual, you may still find it helpful to organize your bar based on basics to thresholds to ultimate. Refer to the revolution bars as examples. Transitioning from revo to full manual can seem intimidating but all it takes is practice. Most players start by letting revolution activate basics while they manually input thresholds and ultimates. The next step would be to manually activate basic abilities too, with revolution still active as a failsafe. Once you feel confident in activating basic abilities manually, try turning off revolution. An exercise to help you here is to only use basics for a full minute of combat on a combat dummy. Your goal is to not lose any ticks between basic abilities, either due to cooldowns or due to not manually activating the next ability fast enough. Once you get comfortable at a combat dummy, try on a real boss such as GWD1 (Graador/Kr'il/Kree) or GWD2 (Vindicta). There is no easy \"trick\" to skip past the practice.

However, there's a catch. High damaging abilities often come with long cooldowns. If you use all of the high damaging abilities at once, you will be forced to wait for cooldowns before you may use them again - during which time you are forced to use low damage abilities. To circumvent this, the trick is to use 'filler abilities' - decent damage AND short cooldowns - in-between your high damaging abilities in order to pace your cooldowns. See this image for an idea of which abilities should be prioritized based on damage (in a vacuum) When building a rotation, ability prioritizations AND cooldowns should be on your mind. Filler abilities such as Needle Strike and Dazing Shot should be used in-between high damage abilities such as Snipe , Corruption Shot , Binding Shot-Flanking , and Fragmentation Shot-Walk . Any basic ability with damage lower than Needle/Dazing would be considered a weak ability (Piercing , tuska , sacrifice , binding shot without flanking, richochet on 1v1). If you are 2h or DW camping you will be limited to only one filler ability (Dazing Shot or Needle Strike, respectively. Thus, try to utilize Dazing or Needle as often as possible in your rotations. A basic pattern of Needle -> Ability -> Ability -> Repeat is recommended for camping rotations. For weapon juggling, you will have access to both Needle and Dazing as filler abilities.

If you are using DW weapons it is highly recommended that you use bakriminel bolts for increased DPM. Here's a rundown of the current meta. If a bolt does not appear on this list, it is not considered meta . Ruby bolts - Overall best dps bolt for general pvm. 5% chance to activate, replacing a hit with a new one based on target's HP. The bolts have a shared cooldown per target, making them less effective (but still very powerful) in groups. Around ~70k HP, it is recommended to switch to another type of bolt, as ruby bolts can reduce DPS if the bolt damage is less than the original hit. Diamond bolts - Improves accuracy. Useful for bosses where you want the extra accuracy above all else (eg. Rise of the Six). Onyx bolts - 10% chance to activate, heals 25% of the hit that triggered activation. Also increases damage by 25% on activation. Great for sustained healing, and alternative bolts after ruby bolts are no longer effective. Expensive. Hydrix bolts - 10% chance to activate, immediately granting 10% adren, and +1% on basics for 15 seconds. Used as a utility bolt for pumping out more thresholds while in Death's Swiftness. These are the hardest bolts to use effectively as they require you to improvise a rotation based off of how much adrenaline you gain . Very expensive.

It is critical to focus on being able to fit in 6 thresholds in a Swiftness with an Adrenaline Potion, and 5 thresholds without an Adrenaline potion.

Assuming you have been DW camping until this point, obtaining an SGB or a Decimation bow will allow you to DW/2H switch without switching ammo. Start focusing on never using an ability worse than 157% ability damage. Any Tuska's or Sacrifice in your rotation should be swapped for a Dazing Shot. Maintain the same threshold order in Death's Swiftness and remember to needle strike before snapshot and shadow tendrils for higher damage. From this point onwards we will also incorporate ways to force auto attacks. For Death's Swiftness, using a DW MH for planted feet then switching to 2H will also force an auto attack, which can contribute significant damage. Sometimes clicking your target is necessary to force the auto attack. The sequence of actions goes as follows: Equip DW PF -> Activate Death's Swiftness -> Equip 2h within GCD -> Click target (auto attack will come out here) -> Activate Ability Using Shadow Tendrils with 2H after using a DW ability with a 'fastest' speed weapon allows for stacking an auto on top of the tendrils.

From here the next progression leads to bakriminel bolt switching. Various bak bolts provide a variety of effects which can be useful under different circumstances (see the Bakriminel bolts section for more info). Since most bak bolts have an innate cooldown, we can bypass any downtime by switching between 2-3 bolts to get the most out of their effects at any given time. Bolt switches are usually done between the four meta bolts: Ruby, Diamond, Onyx, and Hydrix. The idea is to pick two or three bolts for a given scenario to minimize downtime between bolt cooldowns and to maximize their effects. For example, the most effective bolt when fighting <#534612663523737619> are Ruby bolts as they are the best dps bolts. However, when attacking minions the most effective bolt becomes Hydrix as minions have a soft hitcap of 1000 so any Ruby procs are wasted. During the last phase, the most effective bolt on Nex becomes Onyx as she is lower than 100k hp thus reducing Ruby's effectiveness. As a general rule: pick Ruby for DPS; pick Diamond for accuracy; pick Onyx for healing; pick Hydrix for adrenaline gain. Mix and match to gain the most out of all of these bolts in a boss fight!

Note: You do not have to strictly follow this should your budget not allow you to do so. Note: Acquiring a charming imp before camping waterfiends will save you a lot of hassle, however it is not required. If you wish to do that, then you should do the Elite Dungeons 1 token farming method. The purpose of this section is to break down, as simply as possible, a relatively efficient means of getting the stats required to begin bossing.

For ALL COMBAT It is recommended to do Elite Dungeon runs in a trio for combat and dungeoneering exp. The two most common methods are: \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Elite Dungeons 3: tag all mobs up until the first boss. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Elite Dungeons 1: tag minibosses for farming dungeoneering tokens while tagging as many mobs as you can. Attack and Strength Note: It is important to always make use of the highest tier halberd you are able to acquire when training both attack and strength. 1-30: Do Waterfall Quest . 30-36: [ Attack only ]: Do The Fight Arena . 30-40: Kill Trolls in Burthope Caves. 40-60: Kill Ghouls outside the Morytania Mauseleum. Do: Regicide for access to the Dragon Halberd. 60-90: Wilderness Abyss. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e-Alternatively: 70-90: Guthans at Hellhounds. 90-99: Either Wilderness Abyss or Waterfiends. Note: The Grand Tree gives a 18,750 experience lamp that you can use on either Ranged, Strength, Attack, Defence, Hp or Magic. It is recommended to complete this quest and use it on either Ranged or Magic. Range Note: It is important to make use of the highest tier chinchompa you are able to acquire when training range in the abyss. Note: Unlock ability ASAP. 1-40: Kill Trolls in Burthope Caves. 40-60: Kill Ghouls outside the Morytania Mausoleum. 60-90: Wilderness Abyss with chinchompas. 90-99: Waterfiends in Ancient Cavern (Make sure to pick up all crimson and blue charms, and some gold charms). Magic Note: Unlock ability ASAP. 1-40: Kill Trolls in Burthope Caves. Note: At 30 magic you have the magic level for Evil Dave's Big day out, it is recommended to do this quest should you have the stats as it gives 50,000 magic experience. 40-60: Kill Ghouls outside the Morytania Mausoleum. 60-90: Wilderness Abyss. 90-99: Waterfiends in Ancient Cavern (Make sure to pick up all crimson and blue charms, and some gold charms). Prayer 1-27: Do: Restless Ghost ; Priest in Peril ; One Piercing Note , and then God Statues monthly d&d. 27-95: Dragon bones on gilded altar with 2 lit burners OR wilderness chaos altar (this should cost ~70m). Note: Once you reach 70 prayer you can make use of the Piety variants of prayers, allowing you access to a relatively decent damage-boosting prayer to start bossing with. It is recommended to do this so you can fund 95 prayer more easily. Summoning This section assumes you have already done either 90-99 Ranged, Magic, Strength or Attack at Waterfiends and therefore have the gold and crimson charms needed for 87 Note: Making use of the Familiarisation minigame will greatly aid in farming charms from Waterfiends. Note: Charming potions increase the number of charms dropped per kill by 1 for every mob, purchaseable from the Grand Exchange, and highly recommended when training combat via ED3, as the blue charms can be used to accelerate your summoning training. \u200e \u200e 1-4: Do Wolf Whistle 4-16: Make Dreadfowls 16-32: Make Granite Crabs 32-46: Make Honeybadgers 46-49: Make Pyrelords 49-61: Make Bloated Leeches 61-64: Make Smoke Devils or Bloated Leeches 64-74: Make Stranger Plants or Smoke Devils 74-87: Make Granite Lobsters Herblore Warbands is one of the best ways to cut the costs of herblore, and is relatively efficient as well. However, you want to stop at around 84 so you can stockpile on potions for PvM as you hit 99. That being said, you may still continue to do them daily anyway. Note: If possible, you can wait for a Double Experience Weekend before training herblore to halve the overall cost. Note: Always make use of portable wells when making potions for the +10% experience boost. 1-84: Do Warbands daily 84-88: Adrenaline Potions 88-96: Make ~3350 of each extreme [Should that not be enough, just make some more adrenaline potions OR more extremes of equal amounts until you hit 96] 96-99: Overloads Crafting 80 crafting is required for invention Note: You can join a clan and make use of the weaving loom there for some crafting experience. Slow but free : 1-80: Dungeoneering Crafting - This method involves crafting either the magic or range armour in dungeoneering, selling that to smuggler, buying more supplies then repeating. Slow but cheap 1-80: Making the highest tier urn that you can. Fast but expensive 20-80: Cutting gems (sapphire, rubies, emeralds, diamonds). 63-80: Making dragonhide armour. Divination 80 is needed for invention 1-80: Guthixian Caches \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200eNote: You want to start doing Caches ASAP [At low level do them on legacy worlds, as there will be fewer people so you can Cres more often] Smithing 80 smithing is required for invention 1-30: Do The Knight's Sword then make steel platebodies 30-40: Make mithril platebodies 40-50: Make adamant platebodies 50-60: Make rune platebodies 60-70: Make orichalkum platebodies 70-80: Make necrite platebodies Invention Note: You are able to use invention potions to boost and discover blueprints for experience. 1-4: Do invention tutorial 4-27: Research lvl 5 max items, then augment t70-75 gear, black salamanders are relatively cheap, then kill waterfiends and then disassemble when it hits level 5 27-60: Research lvl 10 max items, then disassemble items once they hit level 10 60-99/120: Either augment relatively cheap halberd/staff weapons and go to wilderness abyss to level (or abyssal demons if you have the slayer level) and disassemble at level 10 OR Augment a relatively expensive (t80+) weapon and level it to 12 then siphon. Item experience is directly tied to combat experience, so high combat xp training methods such as ED3 are recommended, or afking at abyssal demons should you have trained slayer enough. Quests For a breakdown of quests you should focus on getting done, read them over in <#689234925064290323>. However, you should especially be focused on doing the The Temple at Senntisten , as it unlocks curses.

Note: Unlock ability ASAP. 1-40: Kill Trolls in Burthope Caves. 40-60: Kill Ghouls outside the Morytania Mausoleum. 60-90: Wilderness Abyss with chinchompas. 90-99: Waterfiends in Ancient Cavern (Make sure to pick up all crimson and blue charms, and some gold charms). Magic Note: Unlock ability ASAP. 1-40: Kill Trolls in Burthope Caves. Note: At 30 magic you have the magic level for Evil Dave's Big day out, it is recommended to do this quest should you have the stats as it gives 50,000 magic experience. 40-60: Kill Ghouls outside the Morytania Mausoleum. 60-90: Wilderness Abyss. 90-99: Waterfiends in Ancient Cavern (Make sure to pick up all crimson and blue charms, and some gold charms). Prayer 1-27: Do: Restless Ghost ; Priest in Peril ; One Piercing Note , and then God Statues monthly d&d. 27-95: Dragon bones on gilded altar with 2 lit burners OR wilderness chaos altar (this should cost ~70m). Note: Once you reach 70 prayer you can make use of the Piety variants of prayers, allowing you access to a relatively decent damage-boosting prayer to start bossing with. It is recommended to do this so you can fund 95 prayer more easily. Summoning This section assumes you have already done either 90-99 Ranged, Magic, Strength or Attack at Waterfiends and therefore have the gold and crimson charms needed for 87 Note: Making use of the Familiarisation minigame will greatly aid in farming charms from Waterfiends. Note: Charming potions increase the number of charms dropped per kill by 1 for every mob, purchaseable from the Grand Exchange, and highly recommended when training combat via ED3, as the blue charms can be used to accelerate your summoning training. \u200e \u200e 1-4: Do Wolf Whistle 4-16: Make Dreadfowls 16-32: Make Granite Crabs 32-46: Make Honeybadgers 46-49: Make Pyrelords 49-61: Make Bloated Leeches 61-64: Make Smoke Devils or Bloated Leeches 64-74: Make Stranger Plants or Smoke Devils 74-87: Make Granite Lobsters Herblore Warbands is one of the best ways to cut the costs of herblore, and is relatively efficient as well. However, you want to stop at around 84 so you can stockpile on potions for PvM as you hit 99. That being said, you may still continue to do them daily anyway. Note: If possible, you can wait for a Double Experience Weekend before training herblore to halve the overall cost. Note: Always make use of portable wells when making potions for the +10% experience boost. 1-84: Do Warbands daily 84-88: Adrenaline Potions 88-96: Make ~3350 of each extreme [Should that not be enough, just make some more adrenaline potions OR more extremes of equal amounts until you hit 96] 96-99: Overloads Crafting 80 crafting is required for invention Note: You can join a clan and make use of the weaving loom there for some crafting experience. Slow but free : 1-80: Dungeoneering Crafting - This method involves crafting either the magic or range armour in dungeoneering, selling that to smuggler, buying more supplies then repeating. Slow but cheap 1-80: Making the highest tier urn that you can. Fast but expensive 20-80: Cutting gems (sapphire, rubies, emeralds, diamonds). 63-80: Making dragonhide armour. Divination 80 is needed for invention 1-80: Guthixian Caches \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200eNote: You want to start doing Caches ASAP [At low level do them on legacy worlds, as there will be fewer people so you can Cres more often] Smithing 80 smithing is required for invention 1-30: Do The Knight's Sword then make steel platebodies 30-40: Make mithril platebodies 40-50: Make adamant platebodies 50-60: Make rune platebodies 60-70: Make orichalkum platebodies 70-80: Make necrite platebodies Invention Note: You are able to use invention potions to boost and discover blueprints for experience. 1-4: Do invention tutorial 4-27: Research lvl 5 max items, then augment t70-75 gear, black salamanders are relatively cheap, then kill waterfiends and then disassemble when it hits level 5 27-60: Research lvl 10 max items, then disassemble items once they hit level 10 60-99/120: Either augment relatively cheap halberd/staff weapons and go to wilderness abyss to level (or abyssal demons if you have the slayer level) and disassemble at level 10 OR Augment a relatively expensive (t80+) weapon and level it to 12 then siphon. Item experience is directly tied to combat experience, so high combat xp training methods such as ED3 are recommended, or afking at abyssal demons should you have trained slayer enough. Quests For a breakdown of quests you should focus on getting done, read them over in <#689234925064290323>. However, you should especially be focused on doing the The Temple at Senntisten , as it unlocks curses.

Let\u2019s start from the beginning. The revolution combat mode allows the game to automatically activate abilities on your ability bar in a sequential order. There are three modes to revolution: only basics, basics and thresholds, or basics and thresholds and ultimates. The first option is what is generally referred to as \u2018revolution\u2019 whereas the latter two are referred to as \u2018revo++\u2019. Full manual is a combat mode where the game does not activate any abilities for you. Every ability you want to use in combat will require an input from the player. With no inputs from the player, full manual combat mode will only use auto attacks (sword swipes when using melee, arrows from your ammunition when ranging, auto-spells when using magic). For a player just getting into pvm or bossing it is perfectly fine to use revolution. There are helpful guides and ability bar set ups on the official RS Wiki that make revolution viable in combat. For most combat situations and scenarios, revolution is good enough. But\u2026 Full manual exists for a reason and are there for players who are looking to get a little more out of their combat capabilities. In this FAQ, I will go over several reasons and scenarios where full manual is a better combat mode. Revo vs. FM: Canceling channeled abilities Lets look at channeled abilities. These abilities are different from regular abilities as they typically last longer than the global cooldown. A global cooldown is 3 ticks and is inherently tied to all abilities. A channeled ability will last anywhere from 4 to 11 ticks, or even longer in some cases. For most channeled abilities, there is an ending lag to the ability that can be manually canceled to start the next ability faster. Manually canceling the ending lag, as the name implies, requires a manual input from the player and will not be done automatically by revolution. Take a look at the gif below. Revolution is enabled on both versions. The above player will just let revolution do its thing, no manual input at all. The below player will manually cancel the Snipe ability to initiate the next ability quicker. Notice how long the top player just stands idle after the Snipe? https://i.imgur.com/6uH4KVg.gifv Now, manually canceling channeled abilities can be done on revolution mode. But, it still requires a manual input from the player with precise timing. Revo vs. FM: Ultimates Assuming your revolution is set to only activate basics, you will have to manually activate an ultimate ability such as Sunshine, Death Swiftness, or Berzerk. Now, both revolution and full manual will have to manually input activating an ultimate but the difference is what abilities are used leading up to the ultimate. Keep in mind that in the revolution scenario, there are no player inputs besides activating the ultimate ability. In the full manual scenario, every ability is chosen and inputted from the player. In a typical revolution bar, the really powerful abilities are placed first so that they\u2019re used more often. This means that when building up to 100% adren, you have no control over what abilities are on cooldown prior to activating Sun. In sunshine, since all damage is boosted by 50%, you want to save the really powerful abilities till after you activate sunshine. Basics like Sonic Wave, Dragon Breath, and Impact-Flanking. Since the good abilities are placed first on your bar, revolution tends to activate them often and keep them on cooldown. This is a good thing normally, but you can find yourself in a scenario where all the powerful abilities are on cooldown right after you activate sunshine. The below gif will demonstrate such (take a look at what abilities were used right after sunshine). Using full manual, you are better able to plan out what abilities are used prior to activating Sunshine. You can choose to use bleeds such as corruption blast or combust, or you can choose to use a weaker ability such as Tuska\u2019s Wrath right before a sunshine to make sure the good abilities like Dragon Breath and Impact-Flanking are off cooldown and ready to use in Sunshine. Revo vs. Full Manual: Boss Mechanics As you progress in pvm and face tougher and tougher bosses, you will encounter bosses where revolution could greatly hinder your combat ability. Here are a few scenarios where revolution could cause more harm than good: 1) \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e Arraxor \u2013 Web reflect mechanic a. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200ePlayer must manually input to stop attacking, otherwise all damage gets reflected onto the player potentially causing a KO 2) \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e Vorago \u2013 Reflect mechanic a. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200eSame idea, damage gets reflected onto a player and revo requires a manual input to stop attacking 3) \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e Telos \u2013 Hold Still Invader a. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200eThis mechanic is commonly dealt with by switching to a shield and using Resonance. This does require precise timings and if you are on revo, there\u2019s a chance that revo activates an ability while you\u2019re waiting to res. This puts you on global cooldown and suddenly, you are unable to activate any abilities while Telos smacks you silly. 4) \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e Kalphite King \u2013 Green a. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200eThis mechanic requires provoking KK then either using Devotion or Resonance to deal with the instant kill attack. If using resonance it requires precise timing to deal with the attack on-tick. 5) \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e Nex \u2013 Blood Siphon and Blood Phase a. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200eMechanic where any attacks during blood siphon will heal her rather than damage her. Requires manual input to stop attacking during the special attack. b. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200eBlood phase has a mechanic where any bleeds (combust, corruption blast, fragment shot, corruption shot, etc) will heal her instead of damaging her. Requires manual input to avoid using bleeds. 6) \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e Helwyr \u2013 Swipe attack a. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200eMechanic where heavy melee damage will be dealt in a clearly visible melee attack. Common strategy to deal with the mechanic is to Resonance it. Requires precise timing and manual input. More advanced scenarios What if I use revolution but I manually activate basics most of the time? What benefit will full manual provide at that point? This is a really good point and at this stage, there\u2019s very minute things that full manual can offer to aid you in combat. Most of the examples below will relate to auto attacks. Revolution inherently does not interact smoothly with auto attacks unlike full manual. High Input Revo vs. Full Manual 4 tick auto attack: Self explanatory. Undoubtably the biggest reason why many users prefer full manual over Revo (4taa is roughly a 7% dps increase when done well). Revo requires 2x input per every auto attack. One input to make your character stop attacking after gcd and a 2nd input to initiate the auto attack on the 4th tick. Auto attacks happen on every 7 ticks; do the math for a 5 minute boss encounter and that\u2019s a lot of extra input you have to do if you\u2019re attempting to 4taa on Revo. Auto weaving in defensives: When using an ability that does not do damage, sometimes an auto attack will occur during gcd and provide an extra source of damage. Abilities such as Sunshine, Death Swiftness, Berzerk, Resonance, Anticipate, Freedom, Preperation, Reflect, Revenge, Provoke on gcd, Natural Instinct, Eldrich Special Attack (any ability that incurs a gcd but does not deal damage) are all examples of where this happens. Sometimes these auto attacks are purposely used to a) gain extra damage, and b) gain extra adrenaline. Using revolution, it is much more difficult to weave in an auto attack during gcd as inputting an auto-spell will halt any ability casting. Revo users will have to manually input an ability after the auto-spell to start revo again. Full manual users would just need to input an auto-spell during gcd and continue on in their rotation normally. 5 tick auto attack Similar to 4taa, 5 tick auto attack is used in Melee and Range rotations in substitution of an 100% damaging ability. An auto attack in Melee and Range deal an average of 130% ability damage, thus is better than a slice or a piercing shot basic ability. In dps-reliant phases, a 5taa can be used instead of a weaker basic ability as the 5taa is more damage. Revo users cannot do 5taa as there is no auto attack button for melee/range. Positioning On Revo, clicking underneath your character will not stop you deactivating revo. On full manual, clicking underneath your character will stop you from attacking (will stop auto attacks too). While it may seem small, staying on a particular square is important in certain boss mechanics. Examples include but not limited to: \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200eVorago p5, dpsers must stay on the South wall \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200eVorago base, must keep Vorago in base spot for convenience \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200eVorago green bomb in 5 man teams, must form a square between 3 other players and stay in formation \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200eAod base, must keep her in the center of the arena for chinner and minions on p2 and p3. Final thoughts : This is just a reminder that Full Manual is not needed to be proficient at pvm or bossing at all. You can do raids, Telos, duo Vorago, duo Solak, 7man Aod, etc using Revo and many players already do. However, if you\u2019re looking to up your combat capabilities and squeeze in some more dps, full manual offers a range of benefits listed above that revo just cannot replicate.","title":"Revo to full manual"},{"location":"pvme-guides/getting-started/revo-to-full-manual/#revo-to-full-manual","text":"","title":"Revo to full manual"},{"location":"pvme-guides/getting-started/revo-to-full-manual/#why-switch-from-revolution-to-full-manual","text":"Let\u2019s start from the beginning.

Damage is king at AoD. As such, it is extremely important to have solid knowledge of rotations, as well as understand how to squeeze damage in at every opportunity. An AoD preset will be notably low in solid food, and have a significant amount of Blue Blubber Jellyfishes and Guthix Rests, as you are able to spam them during the kill to heal without losing adrenaline. Additionally, it is highly recommended to learn the boss with magic, as on a 7 man team, there will be 1-5 mages at any give time. However, Melee is also extremely viable at AoD and at the time of writing (2020/01/04) is considered meta on more experienced teams with 2-4 meleers on a team. At time of writing, it's encouraged to start at AoD 7-10 server, and end up in Nex AoD FC. Salves are especially nice at AoD, as they save inventory space and also prevent the poison effect during the last 600k of the boss. An amulet of souls is used as you reach very high accuracy at AoD. If you do not 4tick at AoD (highly encouraged to learn to 4tick for this boss), then switches can be removed. Bladed Dive is critical to use during the last 600k in order to travel quickly between pillars around the arena. Each kill should be started at 100% adrenaline, which is why the preset contains an equipped ring of vigour and a cywir wand/ancient lantern (Planted Feet Switch). Starting positioning Presets Beginner Preset \u2b25 for entangle. Mage Ent As you become more familiar with the boss, you are able to incorporate spiritual prayer potions to spam Ripper demon specials, and also bring a dragon rider amulet switch for extra damage on dragon breath. Additionally, once you are familiar with entangle and have a solid understanding of the mechanics at the boss, you can start to do the hammer, chinner, and solo base roles. It is also entirely viable to not use spellbook swap, and should only be done when comfortable. The ancient lantern is used both as a shield switch and as a planted feet switch. \u2b25 \u200e \u200e Elite Tectonic robe bottom (barrows) Invigorating 4 \u2b25 \u200e \u200e Seismic singularity Flanking 4 \u2b25 \u200e \u200e Dark Form Camp dark form the entire kill \u2b25 \u200e \u200e Rune Pouch \u2b25 \u200e \u200e Rune Pouch \u2b25 \u200e \u200e Rune Pouch (Runes for ) The scrimshaw of the elements can be replaced by a grimoire. Quaker/Melee ent Historically needed to hammer the boss during P2 but is no longer needed. Quaker is essentially a free melee who might need to quake the boss. Quaker should only quake if the team has someone off a berserker aura variant, doesn't have a mage or people do not own EoF. 2 rune pouches should be used to allow for group vengeance and disruption shield to be casted. Additionally, knowing how to do good damage with Melee is critical. Spiritual prayer can also be replaced with food if needed. Grimoire is best in slot, but can be replaced with a Saradomin Book or Armadyl book. A vampirism scrimshaw is strongly discouraged, but if needed, can replace a piece of food as a switch. \u2b25 If melee ent, replace with \u2b25 \u200e \u200e Off-hand Drygore mace Flanking 4 \u2b25 \u200e \u200e Rune Pouch \u2b25 \u200e \u200e Rune Pouch (Runes for ) Chinner As the chinner, your job is to help phasing along, and clear the minions while calling the order they die in. Range is used in conjunction with mechanical chinchompas to do this as efficiently as possible. Additionally, the chinner is expected to voke the boss if the base dies for some reason, as they use the least food during the kill overall (especially due to the ability to soul split minions). The multiple eofs are for Dark bow, Sgb, and hammer. Hydrix bolts can be used either on ruby bolt cooldown, or for only the last 600k, depending on how sweaty you'd like to be. Food and spiritual prayers can be adjusted as needed.

However, as teams get faster, more and more mechanics are ignored in some way or another, changing how to respond to them. All of this information is how to handle mechanics in teams that are roughly 3:45 or faster. Elements Do not debil. When Nex starts the element spec, she will choose a quadrant, and that person will receive roughly 3500 x 3 damage. The optimal means of dealing with this spec is to turn on , \u200e \u200eUse to mitigate first hit, tank the second hit, and resonance the third. Generally, by this point, the boss will be phased. If not, switch back to and finish the phase. Reaver Replace an air surge with an entangle and continue DPSing Nex. It is likely that if you're not 4ticking, this section does not apply to you. In even faster teams, it is worthwhile learning how to freedom entangle. This involves hitting your entangle keybind and then quickly hitting your freedom keybind, forcing an offhand auto as entangle, binding the reaver. Mechanic Handling in Faster Teams (Con't) - Phase 2 Shadow Orbs If you get this special, you are not in a team fast enough to benefit from the strategies listed here. Elements If you receive a second elements special, you are not in a team fast enough to benefit from the strategies listed here. Mechanic Handling in Faster Teams (Con't) - Phase 3 Mid Lure and Flanking Sun It is encouraged to do a flanking sun. By luring a minion directly to the middle of the octagon via surge, the sunshine is placed on the edges of the octagon. While this is a learner friendly tactic, the resulting sunshine is placed too far out on the edges of the octagon whereby some minion tanks can no longer flank in their sunshine. In a solo base team where Nex faces West, the Umbra and Glacies minion tanks cannot flank after they surge (without moving out of their sunshine). After your minion spawns do the following: surge, wait for your minion to run to the center, then walk behind Nex while staying inside the octogon. After the 1.8m phasing, activate Sun or the respective ultimate. With your new sun, you can walk freely within your octagon quadrant to get a flanking angle. See the diagram below for how this works. After detonating run to the spot shown in the picture below while attacking Nex so that dbreath hits both Nex and the amalgamation (standing on the amalg works fine but make sure you don't walk yourself). After the amalg dies lure the minion by surging through Nex, once the minion is in the middle you run to the sunshine spot and time it. Diagram on where to stand: Sun spot: Ice Call that you are iced to your team. Freedom and move to ensure that you do not hit any of your teammates, and wait for them to free you. Jump back into the fight as quickly as possible and start doing damage again. It is also possible to free yourself from this spec. If you get iced you can use a powerburst of acceleration to be able to move again via movement abilities. Alternatively you can use it to catch up if you are lagging behind your team during pillars. Freeing yourself from an icicle is very beneficial because not only does it allow you to be free from the damage of an icicle. It also means your team doesn't have to worry about where it is dropped and won't have to help you break the ice, speeding up the kill. Example of freeing from ice can be seen here: https://youtu.be/A8kCwwLCuw4 Smoke Lines This spec is best avoided by counting auto attacks. After Nex marks you, she will do three auto attacks* and the smoke line will spawn on the third auto attack tick. Note: the auto attack immediately after Nex initiates the smoke attack will not have an attack animation as she is still in her Smoke Crouching animation. For ease of keeping track, you could just look for two visible auto attacks from Nex and move away from the smoke line as she does her second visible auto attack. Note that a smoke line occupies two squares width adjacent to the direction they are coming from. For the North smoke, the smoke line will occupy the north line you are standing on as well as the north line one square west of you. For the East smoke, the smoke line will occupy the East line you are standing on as well as the East line one square South of you. Knowing this is crucial in safely placing a smoke line away from your teammates if you intend to stay near the octagon to continue dpsing. Pillars Generally, you should have use of both surge and bladed dive to maneuver around the arena as fast as possible. Last Pillar Place your sun at max cast distance away from the edges of the arena. If the entire team does this, bombs can be places on the edges of the arena without jeopardizing your teammates suns. This allows for quick bomb placements and quick access back to your sun after you safely place a bomb. Miscellaneous Tips (courtesy of @!216433706343202816 , adapted by @!435481585379180554 ) Teams should have one designated debuffer to apply Vulnerability throughout the fight. This is usually the Umbra minion tank's job. vuln should be applied at the start of the fight, to Umbra, at 1.8m after you surge, to each pillar, and at 600k near last pillar. The reason there is only one debuffer on the team is because every vuln auto is a lost auto attack. (as an Umbra tank you can vuln bomb Umbra to save time) While Reavers are stunned by ice, wrack will apply 188% average ability damage instead of 94% ability damage, making it as strong as a Dragonbreath but with a 3 second cooldown. This allows for Reavers to be killed fast provided they are still stunned by ice. On Amalgamations, every Steel Titan special can hit upwards of 4k damage which significantly contributes to a speedy phase. Titan targeting can be inconsistent and if possible, you should manually tell Titan to attack the Amalgamation. The way to do this is to first recall the Titan (whistle button in the familiar interface), then ordering it to attack (by pressing the claw button in the familiar interface). Make sure you have summoning points for the Titan to do its special attack. Also, be sure to set the auto fire rate to \"1\". For NPCs that occupy more than a 1x1 space, the \"center\" square for said target will be the South-West most square. For Nex, she occupies a 3x3 space and her \"center\" square is the South-West most square. When you are attacking with Mechanized Chins, the 3x3 AoE from the Chins will protrude from Nex's center (the South-West square). This means that if all minions are lured correctly and standing in the center of the octogon underneath Nex, they will be hit by the Chin AoEs. However, if a minion is mis-lured standing too far South or East (away from the Nex's South-West \"center\") the Chin AoEs will not reach the mis-lured minion. As Chinner, you should be aware of this and be prepared to single-target minions if any happened to be mis-lured Soul Split flicking is fairly easy to do at Nex throughout P3 (1.8m) and P4 (600k) and can save you some food in a pinch. When Nex casts a mage auto attack, the attack is pre-determined to either hit or splash immediately when she casts the mage auto attack. However, due to the auto attack travel time, the damage will not be applied to your character until the mage attack reaches your character. If the mage attack happens to splash, a shield icon will appear on your character immediately when Nex throws out her auto attack. Knowing this, if you see a shield icon appear on your character as Nex does a mage auto attack, you can flick to soul split knowing that that mage auto attack will splash on your character once it reaches you. If no shield icon appears as Nex does a mage auto attack, you know that the auto attack will hit and therefore, you should pray magic. See video attached to see this in action: https://youtu.be/RK5TQER2zeM Stacked Mage Attack. Due to how slow Nex's mage auto attacks travel and due to how large of an attack distance Nex has, it is possible to have two mage auto attacks stack and damage you on the same tick. This can be very dangerous during P4 (600k) when moving around pillars. If Nex first does a mage auto attack while you are at a far distance, then you surge and move in closer to her and Nex does a second mage auto attack, the second mage auto attack will have less travel distance to cover and will likely hit you as the first mage auto attack hits you (remember that the first mage auto attack has a longer travel path, but has more time to travel to you). Knowing this, be wary of stacked mage attacks while surging around the arena. \u200e1 Tick Bombs. During P4, the bomb mechanic will pulse every 3 ticks and therefore damage you \u200e \u200eevery 3 ticks if you are caught in its blast radius. In the unfortunate scenario where there is a \u200e \u200emid bomb and you are marked for an instakill, it is possible to save yourself from the instakill \u200e \u200ewhile also not taking any bomb damage. To do this, you must surge into the center circle, spend \u200e \u200e1 tick standing in the center circle for the instakill mechanic, and move away from the center \u200e \u200ecircle via bladed dive within that same tick. This is referred to as \"1ticking\" a bomb. Note that \u200e \u200ethe instakill mechanic is applied 1 tick after the yellow bar is completely filled, not as the yellow bar fills. This is crucial in timing your surge/bladed dive 1ticking.

Additionally, it is highly recommended to learn the boss with magic, as on a 7 man team, there will be 1-5 mages at any give time.

However, as teams get faster, more and more mechanics are ignored in some way or another, changing how to respond to them. All of this information is how to handle mechanics in teams that are roughly 3:45 or faster. Elements Do not debil. When Nex starts the element spec, she will choose a quadrant, and that person will receive roughly 3500 x 3 damage. The optimal means of dealing with this spec is to turn on , \u200e \u200eUse to mitigate first hit, tank the second hit, and resonance the third. Generally, by this point, the boss will be phased. If not, switch back to and finish the phase. Reaver Replace an air surge with an entangle and continue DPSing Nex. It is likely that if you're not 4ticking, this section does not apply to you. In even faster teams, it is worthwhile learning how to freedom entangle. This involves hitting your entangle keybind and then quickly hitting your freedom keybind, forcing an offhand auto as entangle, binding the reaver. Mechanic Handling in Faster Teams (Con't) - Phase 2 Shadow Orbs If you get this special, you are not in a team fast enough to benefit from the strategies listed here. Elements If you receive a second elements special, you are not in a team fast enough to benefit from the strategies listed here. Mechanic Handling in Faster Teams (Con't) - Phase 3 Mid Lure and Flanking Sun It is encouraged to do a flanking sun. By luring a minion directly to the middle of the octagon via surge, the sunshine is placed on the edges of the octagon. While this is a learner friendly tactic, the resulting sunshine is placed too far out on the edges of the octagon whereby some minion tanks can no longer flank in their sunshine. In a solo base team where Nex faces West, the Umbra and Glacies minion tanks cannot flank after they surge (without moving out of their sunshine). After your minion spawns do the following: surge, wait for your minion to run to the center, then walk behind Nex while staying inside the octogon. After the 1.8m phasing, activate Sun or the respective ultimate. With your new sun, you can walk freely within your octagon quadrant to get a flanking angle. See the diagram below for how this works. After detonating run to the spot shown in the picture below while attacking Nex so that dbreath hits both Nex and the amalgamation (standing on the amalg works fine but make sure you don't walk yourself). After the amalg dies lure the minion by surging through Nex, once the minion is in the middle you run to the sunshine spot and time it. Diagram on where to stand: Sun spot: Ice Call that you are iced to your team. Freedom and move to ensure that you do not hit any of your teammates, and wait for them to free you. Jump back into the fight as quickly as possible and start doing damage again. It is also possible to free yourself from this spec. If you get iced you can use a powerburst of acceleration to be able to move again via movement abilities. Alternatively you can use it to catch up if you are lagging behind your team during pillars. Freeing yourself from an icicle is very beneficial because not only does it allow you to be free from the damage of an icicle. It also means your team doesn't have to worry about where it is dropped and won't have to help you break the ice, speeding up the kill. Example of freeing from ice can be seen here: https://youtu.be/A8kCwwLCuw4 Smoke Lines This spec is best avoided by counting auto attacks. After Nex marks you, she will do three auto attacks* and the smoke line will spawn on the third auto attack tick. Note: the auto attack immediately after Nex initiates the smoke attack will not have an attack animation as she is still in her Smoke Crouching animation. For ease of keeping track, you could just look for two visible auto attacks from Nex and move away from the smoke line as she does her second visible auto attack. Note that a smoke line occupies two squares width adjacent to the direction they are coming from. For the North smoke, the smoke line will occupy the north line you are standing on as well as the north line one square west of you. For the East smoke, the smoke line will occupy the East line you are standing on as well as the East line one square South of you. Knowing this is crucial in safely placing a smoke line away from your teammates if you intend to stay near the octagon to continue dpsing. Pillars Generally, you should have use of both surge and bladed dive to maneuver around the arena as fast as possible. Last Pillar Place your sun at max cast distance away from the edges of the arena. If the entire team does this, bombs can be places on the edges of the arena without jeopardizing your teammates suns. This allows for quick bomb placements and quick access back to your sun after you safely place a bomb. Miscellaneous Tips (courtesy of @!216433706343202816 , adapted by @!435481585379180554 ) Teams should have one designated debuffer to apply Vulnerability throughout the fight. This is usually the Umbra minion tank's job. vuln should be applied at the start of the fight, to Umbra, at 1.8m after you surge, to each pillar, and at 600k near last pillar. The reason there is only one debuffer on the team is because every vuln auto is a lost auto attack. (as an Umbra tank you can vuln bomb Umbra to save time) While Reavers are stunned by ice, wrack will apply 188% average ability damage instead of 94% ability damage, making it as strong as a Dragonbreath but with a 3 second cooldown. This allows for Reavers to be killed fast provided they are still stunned by ice. On Amalgamations, every Steel Titan special can hit upwards of 4k damage which significantly contributes to a speedy phase. Titan targeting can be inconsistent and if possible, you should manually tell Titan to attack the Amalgamation. The way to do this is to first recall the Titan (whistle button in the familiar interface), then ordering it to attack (by pressing the claw button in the familiar interface). Make sure you have summoning points for the Titan to do its special attack. Also, be sure to set the auto fire rate to \"1\". For NPCs that occupy more than a 1x1 space, the \"center\" square for said target will be the South-West most square. For Nex, she occupies a 3x3 space and her \"center\" square is the South-West most square. When you are attacking with Mechanized Chins, the 3x3 AoE from the Chins will protrude from Nex's center (the South-West square). This means that if all minions are lured correctly and standing in the center of the octogon underneath Nex, they will be hit by the Chin AoEs. However, if a minion is mis-lured standing too far South or East (away from the Nex's South-West \"center\") the Chin AoEs will not reach the mis-lured minion. As Chinner, you should be aware of this and be prepared to single-target minions if any happened to be mis-lured Soul Split flicking is fairly easy to do at Nex throughout P3 (1.8m) and P4 (600k) and can save you some food in a pinch. When Nex casts a mage auto attack, the attack is pre-determined to either hit or splash immediately when she casts the mage auto attack. However, due to the auto attack travel time, the damage will not be applied to your character until the mage attack reaches your character. If the mage attack happens to splash, a shield icon will appear on your character immediately when Nex throws out her auto attack. Knowing this, if you see a shield icon appear on your character as Nex does a mage auto attack, you can flick to soul split knowing that that mage auto attack will splash on your character once it reaches you. If no shield icon appears as Nex does a mage auto attack, you know that the auto attack will hit and therefore, you should pray magic. See video attached to see this in action: https://youtu.be/RK5TQER2zeM Stacked Mage Attack. Due to how slow Nex's mage auto attacks travel and due to how large of an attack distance Nex has, it is possible to have two mage auto attacks stack and damage you on the same tick. This can be very dangerous during P4 (600k) when moving around pillars. If Nex first does a mage auto attack while you are at a far distance, then you surge and move in closer to her and Nex does a second mage auto attack, the second mage auto attack will have less travel distance to cover and will likely hit you as the first mage auto attack hits you (remember that the first mage auto attack has a longer travel path, but has more time to travel to you). Knowing this, be wary of stacked mage attacks while surging around the arena. \u200e1 Tick Bombs. During P4, the bomb mechanic will pulse every 3 ticks and therefore damage you \u200e \u200eevery 3 ticks if you are caught in its blast radius. In the unfortunate scenario where there is a \u200e \u200emid bomb and you are marked for an instakill, it is possible to save yourself from the instakill \u200e \u200ewhile also not taking any bomb damage. To do this, you must surge into the center circle, spend \u200e \u200e1 tick standing in the center circle for the instakill mechanic, and move away from the center \u200e \u200ecircle via bladed dive within that same tick. This is referred to as \"1ticking\" a bomb. Note that \u200e \u200ethe instakill mechanic is applied 1 tick after the yellow bar is completely filled, not as the yellow bar fills. This is crucial in timing your surge/bladed dive 1ticking.

He can be fought solo or duo, although he is considerably stronger if you duo. When there are two people fighting instead of one, Araxxor's attacks are doubled, and the higher of the two base rage values is used. This includes minion spawns and its strength in general. The fight is heavily influenced by the players choice. The player must choose from one of the available paths at the beginning of the fight by burning one of the giant webs near entrance of the hive and waiting one minute until the chosen path becomes available. The player's choice of path will affect Araxxor's combat mechanics throughout the rest of the fight. Only two of the three paths are available on any given day. Despite displaying a \"None\" weakness in the combat interface, Araxxor's 3 different forms actually have weaknesses in line with the combat triangle. Players carrying an araxyte pheromone in their inventory will cause Araxxor to spawn using a combat style favourable to the player. For example, using ranged to fight Araxxor while holding an araxyte pheromone in one's inventory will cause Araxxor to spawn using Magic. If utilizing a pheromone, take care to enter the fight wielding your primary weapon or Araxxor can inadvertently spawn as a combat style you are weak to (i.e. entering the battle with your enhanced excalibur equipped will cause Araxxor to spawn as a melee type). Araxxor cannot be hurt by familiars or dreadnips. It is highly recomended to use the NopeNopeNope perk from POF; it may be obtained by keeping an elder spider along with a farm totem in each medium paddock Drops His drops include components for three level 90 two-handed weapons, one for each combat style, along with a pet, with multiple skins to be unlocked for the pet through achievements. \u2b25 \u200e \u200e Pheromone 1/(50-[Enrage/20]) \u2b25 \u200e \u200e Leg piece 1/40 (1/70 in duo) \u2b25 \u200e \u200e Hilt 1/120 \u200e \u200e(1/200 in duo) \u2b25 \u200e \u200e Araxyte egg 1/500 (200 threshold) It is recommended to use melee as it will result in the smoothest and fastest kills. Range may be used when learning but using mage is always a bad idea since this will spawn the melee version of rax which applies bleeds; this makes it harder to learn and is a nuisance in general. Presets Intermediate Preset Once comfortable, it is encouraged to switch to killing Araxxor with a melee setup and a scythe. Stay at halberd range (2 squares) so as to not receive melee auto attacks, and DPS away. Melee has higher inherent damage output than range, so the kills will become smoother. A will also help you keep your life points high. It is recommended to take salves or some other method of poison prevention, as the range version will repeatedly poison you and eat away at an antipoison timer. Once food is easier to conserve, switch from a Pack Yak to a Blood Nihil for higher accuracy. As a meleer, should be used when possible, and your highest tier otherwise. Experienced Preset Once more seasoned at the boss, it is recommended to start incorporating a DW/2H switching rotation with melee. This allows for very high DPS output. A combat dummy is brought for building adrenaline during the P4 transition. If you want efficient kph, use the grimoire, if you want efficient gp/hr, use vamp scrim. If choosing to use a grim it is mainly beneficial to use during phase 2,3 and 4; at higher enrages it would be better to just camp the vamp scrim. Jellies are used for healing over time without losing adrenaline. Sailfish and brews can be used for panic eating. A can be brought for helping to AoE minions that may spawn when Path 1 is open, as well as to stay safe outside of melee distance on higher enrages as needed. ZGS and SGB are brought for their respective special attacks. \u2b25 \u200e \u200e Rune Pouch (Runes for ) Mechanics Note: Araxxor will use a special attack every 5 auto attacks. Generally, this should be prepared for by using anticipate or freedom before the 5th auto attack, so the player is not pulled in by cleave or receives a long bind for coccoon. Araxxor will never use the same special twice in a row. For example, if araxxor cleaves, the next special will not be a cleave. Standing in scythe distance In order to take advantage of the 2 tile range of halberds you must stand out of melee distance. This can easily be practiced anywhere, however for p4 there are some indicators which can help you. Below is an image of \"scythe range\" for phase 4, with a recommended visual position. And following is a clip for better visual representation https://youtu.be/daiPvzj7J40 Cleave Dealing with cleave is rather simple. If you have not used anticipate or freedom beforehand, you will be pulled in and have roughly 2 ticks to react to cleave. Simply move away from Araxxor to avoid taking damage. Cleave is particularly deadly at high enrages, as it has very high KO potential. Cocoon You will take damage for every tick you are still inside the cocoon. When wrapped in the cocoon, simply spam click to escape. The length of this special can be greatly shortened by using anticipate or freedom beforehand. Web Shield Araxxor covers himself with a web and heals himself. This special reflects a random % of the damage you deal back to you. To deal with this mechanic, simply do not attack. It is also a great mechanic to heal off of with resonance, by firing an ability and using resonance to heal from it. It is recommended to use quake if meleeing since it hits slow enough for you to equip a shield and catch the resonance. For range it is recommended to use snipe for the same reason. Be wary of crackling and aftershock proccing during this because it can reflect a lot of unexpected damage back. Minion Spawn When path 1 is open, this special can occur on Phase 2 if Path 1 was taken, or on Phase 3/4 regardless of which path was taken. Araxxor has 20 total minions it can spawn. It spawns them in 4 waves of 5 spiders each. Outside of Phase 4, there is a predictable order to these spawns. Each of the first 3 waves will contain a special spider, either a mirrorback or pulsing. In the first wave, it's the third to spawn. In the second wave, it's the second to spawn. In the third wave, it's the first to spawn. There is no special spider in the fourth wave. Deal with this mechanic by getting off right before the special spider spawns, and killing it asap. Killing the remaining spiders is optional but can help you take less damage if the phase goes slowly. Egg Bomb Araxxor will spawn a group of 2 or 3 eggs, and fire a slow moving projectile at you. To mitigate damage, simply stand on the eggs. The projectile will explode, and kill all eggs within a 4x4 radius. If 3 eggs are exploded, the player will only take 300 damage. 2 exploded will result in 1200 damage, 1 exploded results in 2100 damage, and ignoring the mechanic will result in 3000 damage. If eggs are not exploded, then they will hatch into spiders as well. The first special attack on phase 2 for top path will always be egg bomb. Instakill Spider Only occurs on p2 if acid path is taken or p3 if acid path is open. Araxxor will perform a melee attack animation and send out a projectile which will leave a green mark where it lands; the spider will spawn here. You will see the spider spawn and start walking towards you with a gauge bar above its head that fills up. when it fills up fully the spider will explode and you will be safe. If it touches you before the bar fills up it will explode on you and deal a severe amount of damage. its speed is variable. On p2, if you're already at the HP threshold and waiting for the phase to end, either barricade or immortality to negate the damage from the spider, or bladed dive away from it if you wish to save your adrenaline. Since phase 3 is a damage gated phase, it's recommended to simply run away from the spider and avoid wasting adrenaline on a defensive ultimate. Acid Spiders On phase 3, Araxxor will sometimes spawn acid spiders. These can be lured to reduce the enrage of the boss by clicking on them and luring them beneath Araxxor, but are generally better off ignored. They are distinct from the instakill spiders encountered, as they do not have a gauge bar, and touching them results in nothing happening. The amount that spawns is related to the amount of acid absorbed in the middle path. You must absorb 50% of the acid in the middle path (100% in duo) in order to proceed to phase 3. If the middle path is not taken, 4 acid spiders will spawn (25% each); this scales down for middle path. Light Spots This occurs the entire time on phase 2 darkness path, and on phase 3 and 4 if path 3 is open. Stand in the light spot to avoid damage. On lower enrages this can be ignored, but starts to hurt at higher enrages. The Fight Phase 1 This phase is timelocked to waiting for the web to burn down. Araxxor should be lowered to ~5k life points before the web is burned down. If doing top path you can optionally use natural instinct when the web is ~80% burnt. If doing path 2 you should use storm shards when they are off cooldown. There is not much else to this phase just dodge Araxxors specs and move to the next phase when the web burns. Phase 2 Top Path Optionally phase right after a spec on P1. The first special on P2 is always an egg bomb, this gives you time to dps Araxxor down. Do whatever you can do deal damage quickly on phase 2. If you have greater barge, you should utilize this to increase your burst damage. You should ideally never get a minion spawn on P2 Middle Path During this phase Araxxor must be lured to the acid pool and allowed to absorb atleast 55% acid, then moved onto the platform inorder to degrade it. Araxxor should ideally be lured right next to the web during P1, once the web is burned down surge/bd to the ramp (setup guide for this can be seen in the example videos). Make sure to keep using storm shards. Doing this correctly will allow araxxor to start absorbing acid 6 seconds sooner than normal, since he only tries to start absorbing acid every 6 seconds. Once he has absorbed enough acid, surge to top of the ramp and wait for the acid to degrade the platform. Use natural instinct just as the acidity level falls below 20% (assuming you moved to the ramp at the right time). Berserk just as you jump off the platform. Bottom Path Phase 2 on bottom path is a timelocked phase where the arena is covered in darkness and you must move to the light spots to avoid taking damage. Araxxor will charge at you at a random interval; this leads to a cutscene where you must dodge his attack. The following inforgraphic shows all four possible movements. Dodging the attack correctly will destroy the wall and let you into phase 3. failing it only destroys the wall 50%. This means you must do it once successfully or twice if you mess up. You can move during the wall charge animation once Araxxor has hit the wall. This gives you some extra distance before the animation is over, resulting in you taking less damage from the darkness. You can also use defensive abilities to stay in combat during the wall charge animation. This lets you stay in combat stance and preserve adrenaline. An adrenaline urn or the persistent rage relic can also help with this. It is very beneficial to have bladed dive unlocked and mobile perk on some piece of gear, along with double surge unlocked. Position your character to always face the longer part of the hallway. this lets you surge straight and then have control over where you bladed dive ahead of you from there, making it easier to reach the light quickly. If the light spawns behind you, you can simply bladed dive to it. Prayer can be conserved on bottom path by turning it off since you won't be attack anything besides the occasional minion and you can just prayer flick the attacks that Araxxor does. You can conserve food by using resonance on Araxxors range/mage attack whenever possible. Phase 3 During this phase Araxxor can use special attacks from any of the open paths. General approach is to just DPS as fast as you can while being wary of specs. \u2192 \u2192 DPS (try to bleed a threshold with greater barge buff for extra burst damage). Phase 4 This is the final phase of the fight, where you will fight Araxxi. Araxxi uses both range or mage attacks if you are not in melee distance. She will alternate her projectile attacks to whatever you are not praying against. If you are in melee distance, Araxxi will use either melee or mage attacks at random. It is recommended to camp melee prayer and flick to mage prayer when you see a mage attack, then back to melee again. At 50k HP Araxxi will stop doing any specials and start hitting faster and harder. She also takes 50% less damage from all hits from 50k-25k hp. At 25k HP she will drain your adrenaline by 50%, and release an acid core. The core will bounce around the room a few times before landing on the player, and doing ticks of damage until the player moves from their tile. After this, the core will bounce around again. This repeats until the boss is dead. It is best to kill the last 25k hp as fast as possible to avoid the acid core from ever touching you. At the start of phase 4 you can use 2 defensive abilites in order to gain adrenaline, wait to drop combat and eat up to high hp. Then use devotion right before Araxxi is attackable for a bit of extra protection.

He can be fought solo or duo, although he is considerably stronger if you duo. When there are two people fighting instead of one, Araxxor's attacks are doubled, and the higher of the two base rage values is used. This includes minion spawns and its strength in general. The fight is heavily influenced by the players choice. The player must choose from one of the available paths at the beginning of the fight by burning one of the giant webs near entrance of the hive and waiting one minute until the chosen path becomes available. The player's choice of path will affect Araxxor's combat mechanics throughout the rest of the fight. Only two of the three paths are available on any given day. Despite displaying a \"None\" weakness in the combat interface, Araxxor's 3 different forms actually have weaknesses in line with the combat triangle. Players carrying an araxyte pheromone in their inventory will cause Araxxor to spawn using a combat style favourable to the player. For example, using ranged to fight Araxxor while holding an araxyte pheromone in one's inventory will cause Araxxor to spawn using Magic. If utilizing a pheromone, take care to enter the fight wielding your primary weapon or Araxxor can inadvertently spawn as a combat style you are weak to (i.e. entering the battle with your enhanced excalibur equipped will cause Araxxor to spawn as a melee type). Araxxor cannot be hurt by familiars or dreadnips.

Stay at halberd range (2 squares) so as to not receive melee auto attacks, and DPS away. Melee has higher inherent damage output than range, so the kills will become smoother. A will also help you keep your life points high. It is recommended to take salves or some other method of poison prevention, as the range version will repeatedly poison you and eat away at an antipoison timer. Once food is easier to conserve, switch from a Pack Yak to a Blood Nihil for higher accuracy. As a meleer, should be used when possible, and your highest tier otherwise. Experienced Preset Once more seasoned at the boss, it is recommended to start incorporating a DW/2H switching rotation with melee. This allows for very high DPS output. A combat dummy is brought for building adrenaline during the P4 transition. If you want efficient kph, use the grimoire, if you want efficient gp/hr, use vamp scrim. If choosing to use a grim it is mainly beneficial to use during phase 2,3 and 4; at higher enrages it would be better to just camp the vamp scrim. Jellies are used for healing over time without losing adrenaline. Sailfish and brews can be used for panic eating. A can be brought for helping to AoE minions that may spawn when Path 1 is open, as well as to stay safe outside of melee distance on higher enrages as needed. ZGS and SGB are brought for their respective special attacks. \u2b25 \u200e \u200e Rune Pouch (Runes for )","title":"Presets"},{"location":"pvme-guides/high-tier-pvm/araxxor-melee/#mechanics","text":"Note: Araxxor will use a special attack every 5 auto attacks. Generally, this should be prepared for by using anticipate or freedom before the 5th auto attack, so the player is not pulled in by cleave or receives a long bind for coccoon. Araxxor will never use the same special twice in a row. For example, if araxxor cleaves, the next special will not be a cleave. Standing in scythe distance In order to take advantage of the 2 tile range of halberds you must stand out of melee distance. This can easily be practiced anywhere, however for p4 there are some indicators which can help you. Below is an image of \"scythe range\" for phase 4, with a recommended visual position. And following is a clip for better visual representation https://youtu.be/daiPvzj7J40 Cleave Dealing with cleave is rather simple. If you have not used anticipate or freedom beforehand, you will be pulled in and have roughly 2 ticks to react to cleave. Simply move away from Araxxor to avoid taking damage. Cleave is particularly deadly at high enrages, as it has very high KO potential. Cocoon You will take damage for every tick you are still inside the cocoon. When wrapped in the cocoon, simply spam click to escape. The length of this special can be greatly shortened by using anticipate or freedom beforehand. Web Shield Araxxor covers himself with a web and heals himself. This special reflects a random % of the damage you deal back to you. To deal with this mechanic, simply do not attack. It is also a great mechanic to heal off of with resonance, by firing an ability and using resonance to heal from it. It is recommended to use quake if meleeing since it hits slow enough for you to equip a shield and catch the resonance. For range it is recommended to use snipe for the same reason. Be wary of crackling and aftershock proccing during this because it can reflect a lot of unexpected damage back. Minion Spawn When path 1 is open, this special can occur on Phase 2 if Path 1 was taken, or on Phase 3/4 regardless of which path was taken. Araxxor has 20 total minions it can spawn. It spawns them in 4 waves of 5 spiders each. Outside of Phase 4, there is a predictable order to these spawns. Each of the first 3 waves will contain a special spider, either a mirrorback or pulsing. In the first wave, it's the third to spawn. In the second wave, it's the second to spawn. In the third wave, it's the first to spawn. There is no special spider in the fourth wave. Deal with this mechanic by getting off right before the special spider spawns, and killing it asap. Killing the remaining spiders is optional but can help you take less damage if the phase goes slowly. Egg Bomb Araxxor will spawn a group of 2 or 3 eggs, and fire a slow moving projectile at you. To mitigate damage, simply stand on the eggs. The projectile will explode, and kill all eggs within a 4x4 radius. If 3 eggs are exploded, the player will only take 300 damage. 2 exploded will result in 1200 damage, 1 exploded results in 2100 damage, and ignoring the mechanic will result in 3000 damage. If eggs are not exploded, then they will hatch into spiders as well. The first special attack on phase 2 for top path will always be egg bomb. Instakill Spider Only occurs on p2 if acid path is taken or p3 if acid path is open. Araxxor will perform a melee attack animation and send out a projectile which will leave a green mark where it lands; the spider will spawn here. You will see the spider spawn and start walking towards you with a gauge bar above its head that fills up. when it fills up fully the spider will explode and you will be safe. If it touches you before the bar fills up it will explode on you and deal a severe amount of damage. its speed is variable. On p2, if you're already at the HP threshold and waiting for the phase to end, either barricade or immortality to negate the damage from the spider, or bladed dive away from it if you wish to save your adrenaline. Since phase 3 is a damage gated phase, it's recommended to simply run away from the spider and avoid wasting adrenaline on a defensive ultimate. Acid Spiders On phase 3, Araxxor will sometimes spawn acid spiders. These can be lured to reduce the enrage of the boss by clicking on them and luring them beneath Araxxor, but are generally better off ignored. They are distinct from the instakill spiders encountered, as they do not have a gauge bar, and touching them results in nothing happening. The amount that spawns is related to the amount of acid absorbed in the middle path. You must absorb 50% of the acid in the middle path (100% in duo) in order to proceed to phase 3. If the middle path is not taken, 4 acid spiders will spawn (25% each); this scales down for middle path. Light Spots This occurs the entire time on phase 2 darkness path, and on phase 3 and 4 if path 3 is open. Stand in the light spot to avoid damage. On lower enrages this can be ignored, but starts to hurt at higher enrages.","title":"Mechanics"},{"location":"pvme-guides/high-tier-pvm/araxxor-melee/#the-fight","text":"Phase 1 This phase is timelocked to waiting for the web to burn down. Araxxor should be lowered to ~5k life points before the web is burned down. If doing top path you can optionally use natural instinct when the web is ~80% burnt. If doing path 2 you should use storm shards when they are off cooldown. There is not much else to this phase just dodge Araxxors specs and move to the next phase when the web burns. Phase 2 Top Path Optionally phase right after a spec on P1. The first special on P2 is always an egg bomb, this gives you time to dps Araxxor down. Do whatever you can do deal damage quickly on phase 2. If you have greater barge, you should utilize this to increase your burst damage. You should ideally never get a minion spawn on P2 Middle Path During this phase Araxxor must be lured to the acid pool and allowed to absorb atleast 55% acid, then moved onto the platform inorder to degrade it. Araxxor should ideally be lured right next to the web during P1, once the web is burned down surge/bd to the ramp (setup guide for this can be seen in the example videos). Make sure to keep using storm shards. Doing this correctly will allow araxxor to start absorbing acid 6 seconds sooner than normal, since he only tries to start absorbing acid every 6 seconds. Once he has absorbed enough acid, surge to top of the ramp and wait for the acid to degrade the platform. Use natural instinct just as the acidity level falls below 20% (assuming you moved to the ramp at the right time). Berserk just as you jump off the platform. Bottom Path Phase 2 on bottom path is a timelocked phase where the arena is covered in darkness and you must move to the light spots to avoid taking damage. Araxxor will charge at you at a random interval; this leads to a cutscene where you must dodge his attack. The following inforgraphic shows all four possible movements. Dodging the attack correctly will destroy the wall and let you into phase 3. failing it only destroys the wall 50%. This means you must do it once successfully or twice if you mess up. You can move during the wall charge animation once Araxxor has hit the wall. This gives you some extra distance before the animation is over, resulting in you taking less damage from the darkness. You can also use defensive abilities to stay in combat during the wall charge animation. This lets you stay in combat stance and preserve adrenaline. An adrenaline urn or the persistent rage relic can also help with this. It is very beneficial to have bladed dive unlocked and mobile perk on some piece of gear, along with double surge unlocked. Position your character to always face the longer part of the hallway. this lets you surge straight and then have control over where you bladed dive ahead of you from there, making it easier to reach the light quickly. If the light spawns behind you, you can simply bladed dive to it. Prayer can be conserved on bottom path by turning it off since you won't be attack anything besides the occasional minion and you can just prayer flick the attacks that Araxxor does. You can conserve food by using resonance on Araxxors range/mage attack whenever possible. Phase 3 During this phase Araxxor can use special attacks from any of the open paths. General approach is to just DPS as fast as you can while being wary of specs. \u2192 \u2192 DPS (try to bleed a threshold with greater barge buff for extra burst damage). Phase 4 This is the final phase of the fight, where you will fight Araxxi. Araxxi uses both range or mage attacks if you are not in melee distance. She will alternate her projectile attacks to whatever you are not praying against. If you are in melee distance, Araxxi will use either melee or mage attacks at random. It is recommended to camp melee prayer and flick to mage prayer when you see a mage attack, then back to melee again. At 50k HP Araxxi will stop doing any specials and start hitting faster and harder. She also takes 50% less damage from all hits from 50k-25k hp. At 25k HP she will drain your adrenaline by 50%, and release an acid core. The core will bounce around the room a few times before landing on the player, and doing ticks of damage until the player moves from their tile. After this, the core will bounce around again. This repeats until the boss is dead. It is best to kill the last 25k hp as fast as possible to avoid the acid core from ever touching you. At the start of phase 4 you can use 2 defensive abilites in order to gain adrenaline, wait to drop combat and eat up to high hp.

He can be fought solo or duo, although he is considerably stronger if you duo. When there are two people fighting instead of one, Araxxor's attacks are doubled, and the higher of the two base rage values is used. This includes minion spawns and its strength in general. The fight is heavily influenced by the players choice. The player must choose from one of the available paths at the beginning of the fight by burning one of the giant webs near entrance of the hive and waiting one minute until the chosen path becomes available. The player's choice of path will affect Araxxor's combat mechanics throughout the rest of the fight. Only two of the three paths are available on any given day. Despite displaying a \"None\" weakness in the combat interface, Araxxor's 3 different forms actually have weaknesses in line with the combat triangle. Players carrying an araxyte pheromone in their inventory will cause Araxxor to spawn using a combat style favourable to the player. For example, using ranged to fight Araxxor while holding an araxyte pheromone in one's inventory will cause Araxxor to spawn using Magic. If utilizing a pheromone, take care to enter the fight wielding your primary weapon or Araxxor can inadvertently spawn as a combat style you are weak to (i.e. entering the battle with your enhanced excalibur equipped will cause Araxxor to spawn as a melee type). Araxxor cannot be hurt by familiars or dreadnips. It is highly recomended to use the NopeNopeNope perk from POF; it may be obtained by keeping an elder spider along with a farm totem in each medium paddock Drops His drops include components for three level 90 two-handed weapons, one for each combat style, along with a pet, with multiple skins to be unlocked for the pet through achievements. \u2b25 \u200e \u200e Pheromone 1/(50-[Enrage/20]) \u2b25 \u200e \u200e Leg piece 1/40 (1/70 in duo) \u2b25 \u200e \u200e Hilt 1/120 \u200e \u200e(1/200 in duo) \u2b25 \u200e \u200e Araxyte egg 1/500 (200 threshold) Preset Beginner Preset As a beginner range will allow to you keep your distance from Araxxor making it easier to dodge cleaves and melee hits. If you struggle with food management you may use a yak, eventually upgrading to using a nihil. The bolts equipped are Ruby bolts, but can be replaced with Dragonstone or Onyx. This is largely preference. Additionally, if desired, bolt switches can be used to scale range further in difficulty and damage. As with most bosses, it is strongly recommended to use , or your highest tier if reckless is not available For the advanced range method it is important to have 3 things: \u2b25 \u200e \u200e Eldritch Crossbow \u2b25 \u200e \u200e Essence of Finality SGB spec stored \u2b25 \u200e \u200e Limitless ability Relics: \u2b25 / Heightened Senses / Berserkers Fury \u2b25 Fury of the small \u2b25 Death ward A combat dummy is brought for building adrenaline during the P4 transition. If you want efficient kph, use the grimoire, if you want efficient gp/hr, use scrim. If choosing to use a grim it is mainly beneficial to use during phase 2, 3 and 4. Jellies are used for healing over time without losing adrenaline. \u2b25 \u200e \u200e Rune Pouch (Runes for ) Mechanics Note: Araxxor will use a special attack every 5 auto attacks. Generally, this should be prepared for by using anticipate or freedom before the 5th auto attack, so the player is not pulled in by cleave or receives a long bind for coccoon. Araxxor will never use the same special twice in a row. For example, if araxxor cleaves, the next special will not be a cleave. Cleave Dealing with cleave is rather simple. If you have not used anticipate or freedom beforehand, you will be pulled in and have roughly 2 ticks to react to cleave. Simply move away from Araxxor to avoid taking damage. Cleave is particularly deadly at high enrages, as it has very high KO potential. Cocoon You will take damage for every tick you are still inside the cocoon. When wrapped in the cocoon, simply spam click to escape. The length of this special can be greatly shortened by using anticipate or freedom beforehand. Web Shield Araxxor covers himself with a web and heals himself. This special reflects a random % of the damage you deal back to you. To deal with this mechanic, simply do not attack. It is also a great mechanic to heal off of with resonance, by firing an ability and using resonance to heal from it. It is recommended to use quake if meleeing since it hits slow enough for you to equip a shield and catch the resonance. For range it is recommended to use snipe for the same reason. Be wary of crackling and aftershock proccing during this because it can reflect a lot of unexpected damage back. Minion Spawn When path 1 is open, this special can occur on Phase 2 if Path 1 was taken, or on Phase 3/4 regardless of which path was taken. Araxxor has 20 total minions it can spawn. It spawns them in 4 waves of 5 spiders each. Outside of Phase 4, there is a predictable order to these spawns. Each of the first 3 waves will contain a special spider, either a mirrorback or pulsing. In the first wave, it's the third to spawn. In the second wave, it's the second to spawn. In the third wave, it's the first to spawn. There is no special spider in the fourth wave. Deal with this mechanic by getting off right before the special spider spawns, and killing it asap. Killing the remaining spiders is optional but can help you take less damage if the phase goes slowly. Egg Bomb Araxxor will spawn a group of 2 or 3 eggs, and fire a slow moving projectile at you. To mitigate damage, simply stand on the eggs. The projectile will explode, and kill all eggs within a 4x4 radius. If 3 eggs are exploded, the player will only take 300 damage. 2 exploded will result in 1200 damage, 1 exploded results in 2100 damage, and ignoring the mechanic will result in 3000 damage. If eggs are not exploded, then they will hatch into spiders as well. The first special attack on phase 2 for top path will always be egg bomb. Instakill Spider Only occurs on p2 if acid path is taken or p3 if acid path is open. Araxxor will perform a melee attack animation and send out a projectile which will leave a green mark where it lands; the spider will spawn here. You will see the spider spawn and start walking towards you with a gauge bar above its head that fills up. when it fills up fully the spider will explode and you will be safe. If it touches you before the bar fills up it will explode on you and deal a severe amount of damage. its speed is variable. On p2, if you're already at the HP threshold and waiting for the phase to end, either barricade or immortality to negate the damage from the spider, or bladed dive away from it if you wish to save your adrenaline. Since phase 3 is a damage gated phase, it's recommended to simply run away from the spider and avoid wasting adrenaline on a defensive ultimate. Acid Spiders On phase 3, Araxxor will sometimes spawn acid spiders. These can be lured to reduce the enrage of the boss by clicking on them and luring them beneath Araxxor, but are generally better off ignored. They are distinct from the instakill spiders encountered, as they do not have a gauge bar, and touching them results in nothing happening. The amount that spawns is related to the amount of acid absorbed in the middle path. You must absorb 50% of the acid in the middle path (100% in duo) in order to proceed to phase 3. If the middle path is not taken, 4 acid spiders will spawn (25% each); this scales down for middle path. Light Spots This occurs the entire time on phase 2 darkness path, and on phase 3 and 4 if path 3 is open. Stand in the light spot to avoid damage. On lower enrages this can be ignored, but starts to hurt at higher enrages. The Fight Phase 1 This phase is timelocked to waiting for the web to burn down. Araxxor should be lowered to ~5k life points before the web is burned down. If doing top path you can optionally use natural instinct when the web is ~80% burnt. There is not much else to this phase just dodge Araxxors specs and move to the next phase when the web burns. Phase 2 Top Path Optionally phase right after a spec on P1. The first special on P2 is always an egg bomb, this gives you time to dps Araxxor down. Do whatever you can do deal damage quickly on phase 2. You should ideally never get a minion spawn on P2 Middle Path During this phase Araxxor must be lured to the acid pool and allowed to absorb atleast 55% acid, then moved onto the platform inorder to degrade it. Araxxor should ideally be lured right next to the web during P1, once the web is burned down surge/bd to the ramp (setup guide for this can be seen in the example videos). Doing this correctly will allow araxxor to start absorbing acid 6 seconds sooner than normal, since he only tries to start absorbing acid every 6 seconds. Once he has absorbed enough acid, surge to top of the ramp and wait for the acid to degrade the platform. Use natural instinct just as the acidity level falls below 20% (assuming you moved to the ramp at the right time). Bottom Path Phase 2 on bottom path is a timelocked phase where the arena is covered in darkness and you must move to the light spots to avoid taking damage. Araxxor will charge at you at a random interval; this leads to a cutscene where you must dodge his attack. The following inforgraphic shows all four possible movements. Dodging the attack correctly will destroy the wall and let you into phase 3, failing it only destroys the wall 50%. This means you must do it once successfully or twice if you mess up. You can move during the wall charge animation once Araxxor has hit the wall. This gives you some extra distance before the animation is over, resulting in you taking less damage from the darkness. You can also use defensive abilities to stay in combat during the wall charge animation. This lets you stay in combat stance and preserve adrenaline. An adrenaline urn or the persistent rage relic can also help with this. It is very beneficial to have bladed dive unlocked and mobile perk on some piece of gear, along with double surge unlocked. Position your character to always face the longer part of the hallway. this lets you surge straight and then have control over where you bladed dive ahead of you from there, making it easier to reach the light quickly. If the light spawns behind you, you can simply bladed dive to it. Prayer can be conserved on bottom path by turning it off since you won't be attack anything besides the occasional minion and you can just prayer flick the attacks that Araxxor does. You can conserve food by using resonance on Araxxors range/mage attack whenever possible. Phase 3 During this phase Araxxor can use special attacks from any of the open paths. General approach is to just DPS as fast as you can while being wary of specs. Phase 4 This is the final phase of the fight, where you will fight Araxxi. Araxxi uses both range or mage attacks if you are not in melee distance. She will alternate her projectile attacks to whatever you are not praying against. If you are in melee distance, Araxxi will use either melee or mage attacks at random. It is recommended to camp melee prayer and flick to mage prayer when you see a mage attack, then back to melee again. At 50k HP Araxxi will stop doing any specials and start hitting faster and harder. She also takes 50% less damage from all hits from 50k-25k hp. At 25k HP she will drain your adrenaline by 50%, and release an acid core. The core will bounce around the room a few times before landing on the player, and doing ticks of damage until the player moves from their tile. After this, the core will bounce around again. This repeats until the boss is dead. It is best to kill the last 25k hp as fast as possible to avoid the acid core from ever touching you. At the start of phase 4 you can use 2 defensive abilites in order to gain adrenaline, wait to drop combat and eat up to high hp. Then use devotion right before Araxxi is attackable for a bit of extra protection. An example of this can be seen here: https://youtu.be/I536gEqcuNc Advanced Guide Top path Phase 1 \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 This phase is timegated so it can be used to set yourself up for p2 while you deal damage \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Use when the web burn reaches ~70% \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Build adrenaline to 100% and use \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Build back to 100% \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Wait for araxxor to do a special attack after web finishes burning before going into phase 2 Phase 2 \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Start with \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 \u2192 \u2192 towards p3 while doing defensive abilities to gain adrenaline when araxxor does the egg bomb special attack in phase 2 (the first spec that happens in phase 2) Phase 3 \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 You want to turn around in phase 3 as soon as you enter so it is good to learn where phase 2 ends and where phase 3 begins. Crossing the yellow line in this picture will start phase 3. Since you run 2 tiles at a time you can click back towards phase 2 just before you cross the line and your character should still cross it. \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Run to the end of the hallway to start phase 3, then run back towards araxxor. equip ruby bolts again. \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 / (depending on if SGB spec is off cd yet or not) \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 By this point in the p3 rotation araxxor will start spawning minions. look out for the special spider and kill it, then finish araxxor off with bleeds and another / as needed.

Stay at 100% adrenaline. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 When you dodge the charge and Araxxor damages the wall, you can click the minimap to start running into phase 3, and then right click Araxxor when he is going up into the ceiling so you can right click 'attack' instantly in phase 3. This is nice in case minions spawn during p2 to avoid target cycle targeting them instead of Araxxor.

Finish with basics if needed Note: if you get a really good phase 3 SGB spec and it is still on cooldown when phase 4 becomes attackable then you may switch your rotation: \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 good basics until araxxi dies Alternative Top Path Strategy (Courtesy of @213693069764198401 ) The idea of this method is to solo skip phase 3. If that fails then you still have to help carry the damage to finish phase 3 the normal way. This method doesn't get average times as fast as the non-skip method mentioned above, but it has a way faster killtime potential due to being able to solo skip. Extra requirements: \u2b25 A second EoF (Dark Bow spec) \u2b25 Powerburst of acceleration \u2b25 A second dummy \u2b25 Heightened senses relic is mandatory Phase 1: \u2022 at ~62% web burn \u2022 at ~85% web burn \u2022 Build to 110% adren \u2022 Turn towards web, and when it burns, drink the powerburst of acceleration and \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 straight to phase 3, then immediately drop a and , then build adrenaline with basics and defensives using Phase 3: \u2022 Near 100% adren, use and switch to ruby bakriminel bolts, then use + .

As with most bosses, it is strongly recommended to use , or your highest tier if reckless is not available For the advanced range method it is important to have 3 things: \u2b25 \u200e \u200e Eldritch Crossbow \u2b25 \u200e \u200e Essence of Finality SGB spec stored \u2b25 \u200e \u200e Limitless ability Relics: \u2b25 / Heightened Senses / Berserkers Fury \u2b25 Fury of the small \u2b25 Death ward A combat dummy is brought for building adrenaline during the P4 transition. If you want efficient kph, use the grimoire, if you want efficient gp/hr, use scrim. If choosing to use a grim it is mainly beneficial to use during phase 2, 3 and 4. Jellies are used for healing over time without losing adrenaline. \u2b25 \u200e \u200e Rune Pouch (Runes for )","title":"Preset"},{"location":"pvme-guides/high-tier-pvm/araxxor-range/#mechanics","text":"Note: Araxxor will use a special attack every 5 auto attacks. Generally, this should be prepared for by using anticipate or freedom before the 5th auto attack, so the player is not pulled in by cleave or receives a long bind for coccoon. Araxxor will never use the same special twice in a row. For example, if araxxor cleaves, the next special will not be a cleave. Cleave Dealing with cleave is rather simple. If you have not used anticipate or freedom beforehand, you will be pulled in and have roughly 2 ticks to react to cleave. Simply move away from Araxxor to avoid taking damage. Cleave is particularly deadly at high enrages, as it has very high KO potential. Cocoon You will take damage for every tick you are still inside the cocoon. When wrapped in the cocoon, simply spam click to escape. The length of this special can be greatly shortened by using anticipate or freedom beforehand. Web Shield Araxxor covers himself with a web and heals himself. This special reflects a random % of the damage you deal back to you. To deal with this mechanic, simply do not attack. It is also a great mechanic to heal off of with resonance, by firing an ability and using resonance to heal from it. It is recommended to use quake if meleeing since it hits slow enough for you to equip a shield and catch the resonance. For range it is recommended to use snipe for the same reason. Be wary of crackling and aftershock proccing during this because it can reflect a lot of unexpected damage back. Minion Spawn When path 1 is open, this special can occur on Phase 2 if Path 1 was taken, or on Phase 3/4 regardless of which path was taken. Araxxor has 20 total minions it can spawn. It spawns them in 4 waves of 5 spiders each. Outside of Phase 4, there is a predictable order to these spawns. Each of the first 3 waves will contain a special spider, either a mirrorback or pulsing. In the first wave, it's the third to spawn. In the second wave, it's the second to spawn. In the third wave, it's the first to spawn. There is no special spider in the fourth wave. Deal with this mechanic by getting off right before the special spider spawns, and killing it asap. Killing the remaining spiders is optional but can help you take less damage if the phase goes slowly. Egg Bomb Araxxor will spawn a group of 2 or 3 eggs, and fire a slow moving projectile at you. To mitigate damage, simply stand on the eggs. The projectile will explode, and kill all eggs within a 4x4 radius. If 3 eggs are exploded, the player will only take 300 damage. 2 exploded will result in 1200 damage, 1 exploded results in 2100 damage, and ignoring the mechanic will result in 3000 damage. If eggs are not exploded, then they will hatch into spiders as well. The first special attack on phase 2 for top path will always be egg bomb. Instakill Spider Only occurs on p2 if acid path is taken or p3 if acid path is open. Araxxor will perform a melee attack animation and send out a projectile which will leave a green mark where it lands; the spider will spawn here. You will see the spider spawn and start walking towards you with a gauge bar above its head that fills up. when it fills up fully the spider will explode and you will be safe. If it touches you before the bar fills up it will explode on you and deal a severe amount of damage. its speed is variable. On p2, if you're already at the HP threshold and waiting for the phase to end, either barricade or immortality to negate the damage from the spider, or bladed dive away from it if you wish to save your adrenaline. Since phase 3 is a damage gated phase, it's recommended to simply run away from the spider and avoid wasting adrenaline on a defensive ultimate. Acid Spiders On phase 3, Araxxor will sometimes spawn acid spiders. These can be lured to reduce the enrage of the boss by clicking on them and luring them beneath Araxxor, but are generally better off ignored. They are distinct from the instakill spiders encountered, as they do not have a gauge bar, and touching them results in nothing happening. The amount that spawns is related to the amount of acid absorbed in the middle path. You must absorb 50% of the acid in the middle path (100% in duo) in order to proceed to phase 3. If the middle path is not taken, 4 acid spiders will spawn (25% each); this scales down for middle path. Light Spots This occurs the entire time on phase 2 darkness path, and on phase 3 and 4 if path 3 is open. Stand in the light spot to avoid damage. On lower enrages this can be ignored, but starts to hurt at higher enrages.","title":"Mechanics"},{"location":"pvme-guides/high-tier-pvm/araxxor-range/#the-fight","text":"Phase 1 This phase is timelocked to waiting for the web to burn down. Araxxor should be lowered to ~5k life points before the web is burned down. If doing top path you can optionally use natural instinct when the web is ~80% burnt. There is not much else to this phase just dodge Araxxors specs and move to the next phase when the web burns. Phase 2 Top Path Optionally phase right after a spec on P1. The first special on P2 is always an egg bomb, this gives you time to dps Araxxor down. Do whatever you can do deal damage quickly on phase 2. You should ideally never get a minion spawn on P2 Middle Path During this phase Araxxor must be lured to the acid pool and allowed to absorb atleast 55% acid, then moved onto the platform inorder to degrade it. Araxxor should ideally be lured right next to the web during P1, once the web is burned down surge/bd to the ramp (setup guide for this can be seen in the example videos). Doing this correctly will allow araxxor to start absorbing acid 6 seconds sooner than normal, since he only tries to start absorbing acid every 6 seconds. Once he has absorbed enough acid, surge to top of the ramp and wait for the acid to degrade the platform. Use natural instinct just as the acidity level falls below 20% (assuming you moved to the ramp at the right time). Bottom Path Phase 2 on bottom path is a timelocked phase where the arena is covered in darkness and you must move to the light spots to avoid taking damage. Araxxor will charge at you at a random interval; this leads to a cutscene where you must dodge his attack. The following inforgraphic shows all four possible movements. Dodging the attack correctly will destroy the wall and let you into phase 3, failing it only destroys the wall 50%. This means you must do it once successfully or twice if you mess up. You can move during the wall charge animation once Araxxor has hit the wall. This gives you some extra distance before the animation is over, resulting in you taking less damage from the darkness. You can also use defensive abilities to stay in combat during the wall charge animation. This lets you stay in combat stance and preserve adrenaline. An adrenaline urn or the persistent rage relic can also help with this. It is very beneficial to have bladed dive unlocked and mobile perk on some piece of gear, along with double surge unlocked. Position your character to always face the longer part of the hallway. this lets you surge straight and then have control over where you bladed dive ahead of you from there, making it easier to reach the light quickly. If the light spawns behind you, you can simply bladed dive to it. Prayer can be conserved on bottom path by turning it off since you won't be attack anything besides the occasional minion and you can just prayer flick the attacks that Araxxor does. You can conserve food by using resonance on Araxxors range/mage attack whenever possible. Phase 3 During this phase Araxxor can use special attacks from any of the open paths. General approach is to just DPS as fast as you can while being wary of specs. Phase 4 This is the final phase of the fight, where you will fight Araxxi. Araxxi uses both range or mage attacks if you are not in melee distance. She will alternate her projectile attacks to whatever you are not praying against. If you are in melee distance, Araxxi will use either melee or mage attacks at random. It is recommended to camp melee prayer and flick to mage prayer when you see a mage attack, then back to melee again. At 50k HP Araxxi will stop doing any specials and start hitting faster and harder. She also takes 50% less damage from all hits from 50k-25k hp. At 25k HP she will drain your adrenaline by 50%, and release an acid core. The core will bounce around the room a few times before landing on the player, and doing ticks of damage until the player moves from their tile. After this, the core will bounce around again. This repeats until the boss is dead. It is best to kill the last 25k hp as fast as possible to avoid the acid core from ever touching you. At the start of phase 4 you can use 2 defensive abilites in order to gain adrenaline, wait to drop combat and eat up to high hp. Then use devotion right before Araxxi is attackable for a bit of extra protection.

Then you will move southeast of the southern gong and DPS Beastmaster while the remainder of the DPS deal with pets. Once BM hits 750k HP, you use provoke and allow the base tank to clear their stacks. For the remainder of the fight, you and the base tank will alternate tanking. North Chargers Also known as NC. This person runs just north of the eastern gong and opens charger cages in a counter clockwise manner. Then you are to lure the chargers to the southeast corner. It is highly likely that a few chargers will aggro to the Pet Tank or the DPS pile if you do not tag them while luring. It is advised to use chain, corruption blast , or combust to keep aggro. Once in the southwest corner, you should use AoE abilities to kill the remaining chargers. You then become a free DPS and help lower the pets' HP to ~100k. Following that, you are to DPS Beastmaster. Pet Tank 1/3 Also known as PT 1/3, 1/3. This person's job is to tank the first and third pets that spawn. The first pet (it will always be Cormes) will spawn outside the western gong during the 5th wave of minions. Pray against range, use devotion (if necessary), then Sunshine/Death's Swiftness and DPS. Make sure to provoke the pet so it faces away from your team (stand to the north of the western gong). Pet 3 will spawn if Pet 2 is at 500k and will spawn randomly on the map. If Krar spawns, pray against range and utilize resonance/devotion/debilitate as necessary while using a good DPS rotation to lower it to 100k HP. If Tuz spawns, pray against mage and use devotion/debilitate/reflect while using a good DPS rotation to lower it to 100k HP. Tuz will use a bleed in conjunction to its auto attacks so using resonance is not advised. The third pet may jump randomly to \u200e \u200ethe DPS pile or one of the tanks. You must IMMEDIATELY run to the pet, use provoke, and lure the pet away from its target. Pet Tank 2 Also known as PT 2, 2. This person's job is to tank the second pet that spawns. This pet will spawn after the 7th wave of minions and just before BM enters the arena. This pet will always spawn next to the northern gong. If Krar spawns, pray against range and utilize resonance/devotion/debilitate as necessary while using a good DPS rotation to lower it to 100k HP. If Tuz spawns, pray against mage and use devotion/debilitate/reflect while using a good DPS rotation to lower it to 100k HP.

You must IMMEDIATELY run to the pet, use provoke, and lure the pet away from its target. A note for both pet tanks: You want your pet facing away from the DPS pile and tanks so that they do not use auto attacks on them and your team can use flanking on them.

The fight requires 115 slayer (boostable) and a Key to the Crossing for each kill attempt. He is primarily killed for his Phylactery drops, which are used to create the t92 melee Khopeshes of Tumeken and Elidinis. He also drops the t85 Gloves of Passage and the 5 Magister Journals which are required for the Master Quest Cape. It is highly recommended to have at least t90 weapons and to be on a berserker aura as his defence is high. Being on a Soul Devourer task is also helpful as Tuska's Wrath will deal increased damage to the boss, however the slayer helm and genocidal perk effects do not work. Drops \u2b25 \u200e \u200e Vital Spark 1/64 \u2b25 \u200e \u200e Phylactery 1/18 \u2b25 \u200e \u200e Gloves of passage 1/500 \u2b25 \u200e \u200e Soul Fragment 1/1000 (200 threshold) Presets General guidance Bring as many keys as you're comfortable with. When starting out you can have more food and less keys, but food should generally be removed. Dreadnips should always be deployed at the start of the kill, bring more than one per kill in case you end up outside of their range. With max gear you will have 100% hit chance so a ripper demon is recommended. If you have lower tier gear, a nihil is recommended. Additionally, a luck of the dwarves is very good at magister, as it improves the phylactery drop rate from 1/18 to 1/17, which can save the player 30 kills on average while making a full Khopesh. This is roughly equal to a 10% increase in gross profit. On top of this, vital spark enhancers will also increase your profits, since Magister will uncommonly drop vital sparks. Usually, bring 2 super restores however, if you get fast enough kills, the HP drain doesn't matter and you can use spiritual prayers instead. Magic \u2b25 \u200e \u200e Rune Pouch (Runes for ) Melee For lower skill level players, camping a noxious scythe is recommended, this can be used with a ZGS spec switch if you wish to get the best of both worlds. For higher skill players with access to a ZGS, they have no need for a scythe. A grimoire is not cost efficient and is not recommended for use without trimmed masterwork due to the high level of damage you'd be taking. Instead for money-making purposes, use a scrimshaw of vampyrism. Malevolent/Masterwork/Trimmed masterwork is recommended. Ranged Eldritch crossbow is strong due to its special attack in combo with onyx bakrimminel bolts to maintain a healing capacity during the spec. Next are blightbound crossbows for needle strike and their access to bakrimnel bolts. Seren God Bow is the lesser of the four but most definitely nothing to scoff at and 100% viable. > > > > > Ideally you want to make use of both dw and 2h with the strongest out of each category that you have available. The Fight The Magister rotates between a set of special attacks, explained in the next section, randomly with 3 actions in between. This action counter resets back to 3 at 150k, 100k, and 50k hitpoints remaining. His actions include an auto attack, his resonance, freedom, siphon and dashing. He can do some of these actions very rapidly in succession which makes his special attack timings relatively unpredictable. 150k HP The soul obelisk used to start the fight will activate and continuously reduce the player's constitution level (and therefore their maximum lifepoints too), causing food to heal less if your level falls below that which is required by the food to heal to its full potential (potions such as saradomin and guthix brews, by nature of not being \"food\", are exempt from this effect). 3 constitution levels are lost each time the effect triggers. This drain may be counteracted by drinking a super restore. Damaging this pillar will also restore your maximum HP, however this pillar should always be ignored. If you kill the Magister quickly enough, this mechanic becomes irrelevant. 100k HP An additional soul obelisk spawns at the south side of the room, dealing 600 damage every 5-7 seconds and raising the player's corruption level by 4%, causing player's damage dealt and taken to go up by the same percentage. This is beneficial as the boss is very dps focused so just ignore the obelisk. The maximum value this can reach during a fight is 50% however this resets to 25% when Magister dies (if the player was below 25% corruption it does not go up to 25%, only down). 50k HP The Magister goes berserk, increasing his damage output while losing some defence. Kill him off quickly before he can deal too much damage onto the player. As with all the other phases, continue avoiding his attacks until he dies. Actions in depth Resonance Magister will heal for the damage you would have dealt, if you spot this mechanic and you have not yet used an ability, it is best to use a bleed or a weak ability like wrack or the first hit of concentrated blast to minimise his healing. Mutated dazing shot's puncture bleed does a good job of stripping this effect off semi-consistently. Freedom Magister cannot freedom while stunned, he will only use freedom when he is bound, including 0.6s micro-binds at the end of abilities such as impact. While he will not directly aim to clear bleeds using this, he can indirectly do so should you bind him before or during your bleed. As such you should be mindful of using ability combinations such as: \u2192 / ; \u2192 ; \u2192 . This list is not exhaustive. Siphon Magister will only use this when the player is at or above 70% adrenaline. As such the player should aim to maintain a level of adrenaline below 70% during their ultimates so that they don't lose adrenaline which should have been used for critical thresholds. They should also be wary of \u200e \u200ethis mechanic just before using their ultimates as it can cause the player to be drained and accidentally adrenaline pot from 90-100% instead of inside their ultimate after being drained. This can be avoided by delaying drinking your apot until after you know you have used your ultimate, or by using a stun such as impact, backhand, horror and the like before using their ultimate. These last long enough to prevent the magister from siphoning the player if they use their ultimate immediately after. The three above mentioned actions happen instead of an auto attack and instead delay Magister's auto attack by only 0.6s. Dashing Magister will only dash away from the player during his \"Stand Still\" special attack (detailed below). Magister will dash away from the starting pillar in a random direction up to 8 tiles if he is stood too close to it, this usually happens after he uses his \"Barge\" (detailed below) special attack on a player stood close to the starting pillar. The magister can chain these actions together, even up to three in a row (although extremely rare) between special attacks and go spec to spec without any auto attacks inbetween whatsoever. Specials (These are used in a random order with 3 actions in between) Power Blast The Magister slams his staff into the ground, sending out a red lightning attack towards the player. This attack deals RANGED damage and can either be ignored or partially negated by flicking to the deflect ranged prayer or by using disruption shield. If you are struggling for food on trips you can use resonance. This attack is 100% accurate and deals ~2300 damage unmitigated. Barge This mechanic is signaled by the voice line \"You dare fight me?\" After a 1.8s delay, the Magister will barge to 1 sq south of player's location, dealing around 2300 melee damage in a 5x5 area and disabling protection prayers for a small duration. This can be avoided by moving out of the way, it is recommended you move north as this gives you a 1.2s time window to react, moving east or west leaves you with only 0.6s and to dodge it by running south is always an accident as you already have to be running that way when the mechanic starts. If you find this time window small resonance or simply ignoring it is an easier way of dealing with this mechanic. Resonance is also a good option if you wish to make the most of a channel such as rapidfire or asphyxiate but can not afford to lose the lifepoints to face tank the barge. Melee should use disruption shield to mitigate this mechanic losslessly, the healing is unnecessary with the use of a scrimshaw of vampyrism. Move 1 square away afterwards as being melee distance to the boss can trigger the following mechanic. Stand Still The Magister will yell \"Stand still!\" and stun the player for 4.2s, dealing ~2300 melee damage before dashing away in a random direction. It's possible for this combo damage to be very high as he will immediately do a mage attack after escaping, if you do get hit, freedom asap and pray against magic. This is avoided by simply not standing in melee range of the boss but if the player is using melee, they should use a halberd at 2 tile range at lower skill levels, or step away from Magister when he may do a special attack, his ability to do rapid consecutive actions can make this difficult and therefore requires high skill and insight to do well. This mechanic replaces the \"Barge\" mechanic while the player is in melee distance. This mechanic is instant and thus cannot be reacted to proactively, this makes resonance not an option. Unstable Mixture A bomb will be thrown in the general vicinity of the player and will explode after the bar above it fills, dealing typeless damage in a 5x5 area, if caught in the radius this is 4000 damage to the player, 4000 damage to the magister (multiplied by vuln) and 2000 damage to the player's familiar. This can be clicked on to kick it in the opposite direction of the player, if the player is stood on top of the bomb, it will always be kicked south by default. Take caution as this bomb can occasionally spawn without a bar. Furthermore, if the player stands on the tile the bomb is about to land on, the bomb does not spawn. If you restart a kill quickly enough, a bomb from a previous kill can hit him in the next kill. Asphyxiate The Magister will asphyxiate the player, doing a consistent amount of magic damage for 3 hits and healing off the base damage (berserker multipliers and any mitigations are not counted, although corruption is). Contrary to the animation, this ability does not stun and can be dealt with by moving sufficiently far away or by using a melee threshold. This is 100% accurate on each hit, each hit can deal anywhere between 1500-3000 damage unmitigated however every hit deals the same amount of damage as the others. The player should take care to not stun him during this special attack as this will cause him to resume auto-attacking as soon as the stun wears off, even in the middle of his asphyxiate causing unnecessary damage, if stunned by accident, the player should make an effort to chain their stuns to keep him stun locked. Restore Me The Magister will regain several thousand lifepoints. He is much more likely to use this after falling below 50k lifepoints and it is often the first special attack he will use at that point. This can be avoided by stun-locking him, dealing damage and killing him before he gets the chance to use a special attack. Try not to burn too many thresholds for this purpose as you may end up wasting more damage in the long run than the healing you're aiming to prevent. You can also ignore this point but keep in mind it may take a bit longer than it seems to finish him off. Minions This mechanic only happens once the magister has performed a sufficient number of special attacks beforehand, it is particularly cumbersome and powerful and as such the player should aim to avoid it at all costs: \u2b25 Two Soul Devourer minions will spawn using random combat styles. These have 10,000 HP and will remain until either they die or the fight ends. These deal moderate damage and it is recommended to kill them unless the fight is at least halfway over, melee spawns can be kited with ranged and magic. \u2b25 To minimise your chances of receiving this mechanic you should focus on having high DPS to reset his action counter to 3 as fast as possible (at 150k, 100k and 50k) before he has a chance to use a special attack on some of these phases. Stun-locking the magister and stunning him in general can be very helpful to this end. This makes dreadnips a very powerful ally and quite essential for the fight, especially for players with lower DPS. The stuns they provide can also be used to boost the damage of slice, punish, wrack and piercing shot for free. Their stuns also cause you to take less damage. \u2b25 If the player finds they are taking too much damage, they can use a feather of Ma'at to cleanse their corruption and gain some breathing room, this does however make the next kill or two slower, if the player has to resort to this consistently, it is recommended they practice their DPS more before continuing. Reminder that the Magister will deal more damage when below 50,000 lifepoints, resulting in some of these attacks dealing damage in the mid 3000s. Strategy General The first kill will always be slower as the corruption has not built up yet so it is recommended to start at 100% adrenaline. Avoid using high damaging abilities like , , etc. while the boss is slightly above 150k, 100k, and 50k hp as he will absorb any extra damage dealt to reach those exact numbers. Damage is counted towards progressing phases before truncation. This can be most easily observed in damage boosting ultimates with tuskas wrath, where tuskas may hit 20k+ in zerk but is instead truncated to 15k, you can phase the boss from 170k HP and he will phase at 155k, this can apply to assault hits under zerk and detonate under sunshine as well, it can help reduce getting your damage eaten into phase caps. Magister's phasing is based on him attempting to auto attack or taking a hit of damage within attack range (which is instead mitigated), as such if you are outside of his attack range, he will not phase. This only really applies to sgb and nox bow at 9 tiles when he is bound. This also has the implication that he sometimes will phase a few ticks after reaching his HP threshold instead of instantly which is something to be aware of. This means you should be even more wary about using strong abilities around his HP thresholds lest they get mitigated. For corruption stacks, the speed of the last 50k doesn't matter as much on the first kill, do not burst through it. This will allow you to have higher corruption stacks for the 2nd and 3rd kill for the entire kill, as such you'll be doing more damage overall. However, don't sandbag the speed of the kill. You want to kill him at pace to hit 16-20% corruption by the end of the first kill, 12% is too fast, 24% is fine but a bit slow, 25%+ is too slow. Starting the first kill with an instant ultimate helps to this end, with the latter half of the kill being outside of your ultimate, hence being slower and allowing you to build more corruption stacks without intentionally sand-bagging the speed of the kill. If you're getting fast kills, don't pick up your drop after the kill, pick it up during your next one or once every 2-3 kills in a set. Magic (~80 KPH) Open with vuln bomb and DPS in sunshine while dealing with mechanics. You want to sunshine around half way between his spawn point and the start pillar, and then stand 2 tiles north of magister (1 square away), this leaves you in prime position to instantly walk your bleeds and gives you ample space to run north out of the way of his barge spec. and can be used to give yourself more breathing room if he starts pressing you up against the north wall when he charges and has no down side vs impact and deep impact due to the fact you can't flank him. They can also be used to walk bleeds when your dreadnips stuns him at an unfortunate time but it isn't worth using the basic for doing so in a sun, but it is worth it outside of sun or if you use the threshold followed by a wrack assuming you don't have to get your wm/asphyxiate off at that time for your sun. These work because magister is a 1x1 target. Depending on the player's DPS, kill times can go down to 30 seconds so sunshine timings after the first kill will vary. Try not to Sunshine below 60K HP, but carrying Sunshines across kills from 75K+ HP for example is recommended. Melee (~85 KPH) For melee you'll have to be watching his actions closely and when you expect him to be able to spec, stall your abilities outside of MD and click back onto him once he either performs his next auto attack or does his special attack, when you click back on him to release your stalled ability, press your next ability to stack them on top of eachother, this allows you to losslessly leave melee distance. You will develop an instinct/gut feeling for this in time, however for beginners you will be stunned alot. Alternatively, use a scythe and stand outside of melee distance. Every other kill, + and do your berserk rotation, make use of mutated barge if you can. Your aim is mostly to burst past phases so he doesn't get the chance to attempt a special attack. Then every other kill start the kill with a , if you are at 87%+ adrenaline at the start of the kill you may be able to make use of the mutated barge buff, however don't force the adrenaline at the end of the previous kill as forcing it won't be worth the 1.8s saved by mbarge bleed. Within zgs/zerk use destroy(/or hurricane) first, assault second (and mutated flurry, if applicable, last) so that you can use destroy twice per kill without messing up your next kill's destroy cooldown, unlike if you tried to assault twice in a single kill then instantly in the next. Finish the kills with slaughter and blood tendrils as they do not benefit from being used inside ZGS/zerk and your other strong threshold abilities will be on CD. If your dreadnip stuns the magister when you slaughter, use kick or stomp to walk the bleed instead. In melee's case, the rotation is slightly more resilient, you will find yourself following this pattern on most if not all kills. However, if your DPS happens to be particularly good, you may find your adrenaline potion or sigil coming off cooldown ever so slightly too slow. For much of this, you can simply delay your zerk and use mutated flurry/destroy (depending on how long left you have on apot) then build back to zerk in time for apot cooldown finishing. Going back to your aim of bursting through phases, if you believe you'll fail to burst past a phase with destroy for example, you can interrupt destroy on the 3rd hit with punish and run outside of melee distance on the same tick. Magister can attack before you get your 4th destroy hit off, which also means he can spec and stun you out of your 4th hit as well as waste your time getting back to him, damaging you in the process. This is especially bad if you are in a ZGS spec and he dashes away from the area. However, you can keep channeling your destroy through hits 3 and 4 even if you know a special attack is coming if you believe the 3rd hit will initiate the next phase thus reseting his action counter back to 3 remaining removing the possibility of being stunned. Melee rotations (courtesy of @269934766453817344 ) Kill 1: \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 deci \u2192 (3-hit) \u2192 (dw) \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 Kill 2: (tc) (dw) \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 (dw) \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 (improv, finish with 91%+ adren) Kill 3: \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 (2-hit) \u2192 (dw) \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 (improv, finish with 75%+ adren) Kill 4: repeat Kill 2 rotation Repeat these four rotations for the remainder of the trip. On the last kill of a trip, or if you think you're about to get a personal record, and don't mind ruining the next kill, you can use EoF dclaws to burst the last 50k. On the kills you zerk, if you're 91%+ adren, target him, Anticipate then Zerk and Greater Barge , after walking Slaughter , evaluater your adren and Magister's hp to see if thresholds can still be used and finish the kill with 75%+ adren. First kill is rough since you haven't built up corruption yet, throw in a second Destroy if Magister is still 80k+ hp after walked Slaughter . Dual wield Assault is important because the last hit when cancelled doesn't stack with another hit splat, compared to Assault with 2h that has the last hit stack with the ability you used to cancel. This helps in going over magister's hard cap every 50k lp. Use Punish as a free 188 ability whenever he's stunned/rooted from dreadnips. Walk Slaughter by quickly stepping under him, if he's stunned use kick. Following these rotations, with \u200e \u200egood perks and bis gears, you generally won't have to worry about actual mechanics until the last 50k hp, as if done right he will either be stunned or you do quick enough damage between every 50k hp he doesn't have time to do a special attack. If you feel the phase is going slower than it should, consider running away between every ability as his stun/dash/stand still are the most annoying specials to deal with. Example trip: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZBOQ--5Uis Ranged (~75 KPH) For ranged, every kill, DPS in death's swiftness while dealing with mechanics and vuln bomb every kill. Again depending on the player's DPS timings after the first kill will vary. Like with magic you want to death's swiftness around half way between his spawn point and the start pillar, and then stand 2 tiles north of magister (1 square away) for the same reasons. Unlike with magic however you shouldn't use the ranged equivalents of Shock and Horror: Demoralise and Rout as they lack the 10s bind which means you can't abuse piercing shot in tandem. Shadow tendrils should be used outside of deaths swiftness due to the 25% corruption damage bonus. As the damage is sufficiently high and you will instead lose a much larger portion of your HP for little benefit unless you use erethdors grimoire which is not cost efficient. If you have an Eldritch crossbow, you can use its special attack in combination with shadow tendrils followed by rapidfire and snapshot while death's swiftness is on cooldown, Hydrix bakriminel bolts can be used to cover the burned adrenaline to have 100% in time for death's swiftness and these will likely proc within this time frame. Onyx bolts can alternatively provide healing if needed.","title":"Magister"},{"location":"pvme-guides/high-tier-pvm/magister/#magister","text":"The Magister (Courtesy of @191250961165975552 and @133391081109716992 )","title":"Magister"},{"location":"pvme-guides/high-tier-pvm/magister/#introduction","text":"The Magister is a powerful mage trapped in the afterlife, residing at the very end of the Sophanem Slayer Dungeon at the first gate to the underworld.

He also drops the t85 Gloves of Passage and the 5 Magister Journals which are required for the Master Quest Cape. It is highly recommended to have at least t90 weapons and to be on a berserker aura as his defence is high.

When starting out you can have more food and less keys, but food should generally be removed. Dreadnips should always be deployed at the start of the kill, bring more than one per kill in case you end up outside of their range. With max gear you will have 100% hit chance so a ripper demon is recommended. If you have lower tier gear, a nihil is recommended. Additionally, a luck of the dwarves is very good at magister, as it improves the phylactery drop rate from 1/18 to 1/17, which can save the player 30 kills on average while making a full Khopesh. This is roughly equal to a 10% increase in gross profit. On top of this, vital spark enhancers will also increase your profits, since Magister will uncommonly drop vital sparks. Usually, bring 2 super restores however, if you get fast enough kills, the HP drain doesn't matter and you can use spiritual prayers instead. Magic \u2b25 \u200e \u200e Rune Pouch (Runes for ) Melee For lower skill level players, camping a noxious scythe is recommended, this can be used with a ZGS spec switch if you wish to get the best of both worlds. For higher skill players with access to a ZGS, they have no need for a scythe. A grimoire is not cost efficient and is not recommended for use without trimmed masterwork due to the high level of damage you'd be taking. Instead for money-making purposes, use a scrimshaw of vampyrism. Malevolent/Masterwork/Trimmed masterwork is recommended.

These deal moderate damage and it is recommended to kill them unless the fight is at least halfway over, melee spawns can be kited with ranged and magic. \u2b25 To minimise your chances of receiving this mechanic you should focus on having high DPS to reset his action counter to 3 as fast as possible (at 150k, 100k and 50k) before he has a chance to use a special attack on some of these phases. Stun-locking the magister and stunning him in general can be very helpful to this end. This makes dreadnips a very powerful ally and quite essential for the fight, especially for players with lower DPS. The stuns they provide can also be used to boost the damage of slice, punish, wrack and piercing shot for free. Their stuns also cause you to take less damage. \u2b25 If the player finds they are taking too much damage, they can use a feather of Ma'at to cleanse their corruption and gain some breathing room, this does however make the next kill or two slower, if the player has to resort to this consistently, it is recommended they practice their DPS more before continuing. Reminder that the Magister will deal more damage when below 50,000 lifepoints, resulting in some of these attacks dealing damage in the mid 3000s.","title":"Specials (These are used in a random order with 3 actions in between)"},{"location":"pvme-guides/high-tier-pvm/magister/#strategy","text":"General The first kill will always be slower as the corruption has not built up yet so it is recommended to start at 100% adrenaline. Avoid using high damaging abilities like , , etc. while the boss is slightly above 150k, 100k, and 50k hp as he will absorb any extra damage dealt to reach those exact numbers. Damage is counted towards progressing phases before truncation. This can be most easily observed in damage boosting ultimates with tuskas wrath, where tuskas may hit 20k+ in zerk but is instead truncated to 15k, you can phase the boss from 170k HP and he will phase at 155k, this can apply to assault hits under zerk and detonate under sunshine as well, it can help reduce getting your damage eaten into phase caps. Magister's phasing is based on him attempting to auto attack or taking a hit of damage within attack range (which is instead mitigated), as such if you are outside of his attack range, he will not phase. This only really applies to sgb and nox bow at 9 tiles when he is bound. This also has the implication that he sometimes will phase a few ticks after reaching his HP threshold instead of instantly which is something to be aware of. This means you should be even more wary about using strong abilities around his HP thresholds lest they get mitigated. For corruption stacks, the speed of the last 50k doesn't matter as much on the first kill, do not burst through it. This will allow you to have higher corruption stacks for the 2nd and 3rd kill for the entire kill, as such you'll be doing more damage overall. However, don't sandbag the speed of the kill. You want to kill him at pace to hit 16-20% corruption by the end of the first kill, 12% is too fast, 24% is fine but a bit slow, 25%+ is too slow. Starting the first kill with an instant ultimate helps to this end, with the latter half of the kill being outside of your ultimate, hence being slower and allowing you to build more corruption stacks without intentionally sand-bagging the speed of the kill. If you're getting fast kills, don't pick up your drop after the kill, pick it up during your next one or once every 2-3 kills in a set.","title":"Strategy"},{"location":"pvme-guides/high-tier-pvm/magister/#magic-80-kph","text":"Open with vuln bomb and DPS in sunshine while dealing with mechanics.

They can also be used to walk bleeds when your dreadnips stuns him at an unfortunate time but it isn't worth using the basic for doing so in a sun, but it is worth it outside of sun or if you use the threshold followed by a wrack assuming you don't have to get your wm/asphyxiate off at that time for your sun. These work because magister is a 1x1 target. Depending on the player's DPS, kill times can go down to 30 seconds so sunshine timings after the first kill will vary.

You will develop an instinct/gut feeling for this in time, however for beginners you will be stunned alot. Alternatively, use a scythe and stand outside of melee distance. Every other kill, + and do your berserk rotation, make use of mutated barge if you can. Your aim is mostly to burst past phases so he doesn't get the chance to attempt a special attack. Then every other kill start the kill with a , if you are at 87%+ adrenaline at the start of the kill you may be able to make use of the mutated barge buff, however don't force the adrenaline at the end of the previous kill as forcing it won't be worth the 1.8s saved by mbarge bleed. Within zgs/zerk use destroy(/or hurricane) first, assault second (and mutated flurry, if applicable, last) so that you can use destroy twice per kill without messing up your next kill's destroy cooldown, unlike if you tried to assault twice in a single kill then instantly in the next. Finish the kills with slaughter and blood tendrils as they do not benefit from being used inside ZGS/zerk and your other strong threshold abilities will be on CD. If your dreadnip stuns the magister when you slaughter, use kick or stomp to walk the bleed instead. In melee's case, the rotation is slightly more resilient, you will find yourself following this pattern on most if not all kills. However, if your DPS happens to be particularly good, you may find your adrenaline potion or sigil coming off cooldown ever so slightly too slow. For much of this, you can simply delay your zerk and use mutated flurry/destroy (depending on how long left you have on apot) then build back to zerk in time for apot cooldown finishing. Going back to your aim of bursting through phases, if you believe you'll fail to burst past a phase with destroy for example, you can interrupt destroy on the 3rd hit with punish and run outside of melee distance on the same tick. Magister can attack before you get your 4th destroy hit off, which also means he can spec and stun you out of your 4th hit as well as waste your time getting back to him, damaging you in the process. This is especially bad if you are in a ZGS spec and he dashes away from the area. However, you can keep channeling your destroy through hits 3 and 4 even if you know a special attack is coming if you believe the 3rd hit will initiate the next phase thus reseting his action counter back to 3 remaining removing the possibility of being stunned.

First kill is rough since you haven't built up corruption yet, throw in a second Destroy if Magister is still 80k+ hp after walked Slaughter . Dual wield Assault is important because the last hit when cancelled doesn't stack with another hit splat, compared to Assault with 2h that has the last hit stack with the ability you used to cancel.

If you\u2019d like to know more about mechanics it is recommend to watch this video: https://youtu.be/lN5vy1gEh4o IMPORTANT NOTE Use this video Solely for explanation of mechanics. The methods are very outdated and are not optimal. Introduction RotS is generally done in a team size of 4 and the fight takes place in a split arena where the team is split into pairs. Each side will have 3 brothers, the order of which changes everyday. However you will spend more time running through tunnels than you will actually fighting the brothers, which is why it is important to be proficient at both dps rotations and movement abilties i.e. surge + bladed dive. This is also why having the mobile perk, double surge and bladed dive unlocked is crucial for high kph. At RotS the meta is to AoE the brothers down as fast as possible. Most of the meta and strategy revolve around stacking and luring the brothers so that they can be killed at the same time. By far the best way to do this is to have everyone use mechanised chinchompas and range, melee can be used but you will be fine with range assuming you have a Dark bow Essence of Finality. Chinchompas make almost all abilities AoE. In general, all three brothers on a side are stacked on top of each other and then taking advantage of chins AoE to kill them all. Well-executed, this strategy should result in consistent 15-20s kills on any rotation. Additionally, because the ability rotation is independent of the organization of the brothers, it is very consistent and easy to learn and perfect. Presets Bladed dive is critical to being able to exit tunnels efficiently and increase KPH. One important thing for RotS is to use the Undead Slayer perk, as it will increase your DPS by a flat 7%. Undead Slayer ability, if owned and activated, will also increase your damage against the brothers by 15% for 10 seconds. Trips are generally ~30 minutes long, it is rare to eat during kills and the majority of your food will be used while in tunnels. This negates the downsides of using sara brews + solids i.e. stat drain will be nullified by the time you are back at pads and since you are out of combat you won't lose adrenaline from solids.

When meleeing you want to start every kill with 100% adrenaline. You will every single kill and in order to upkeep your adren you need to manage your adrenaline carefully. This is why you have multiple apots and dummies. As melee you will always incite. \u2b25 \u200e \u200e Adrenaline urn Prevents adren loss after dropping combat, stores up to 1000% adrenaline , can be removed if using Persistent Rage relic \u2b25 \u200e \u200e Ancient elven ritual shard Restores prayer overtime, 5 minute cooldown \u2b25 \u200e \u200e Rune Pouch (Runes for ) What to do Once you know the rotation, it\u2019s easy to apply it to the fight. Both players stand on the same square (DD or death dot) and don\u2019t move unless necessary. Both players should activate their offensive range/melee prayer (Anguish/Desolation or Turmoil/Malevolance) and Soul Link. The incite should pray Protect from Melee and the DPS should pray Soul Split. The Soul Link curse splits both the damage and health healed from Soul Split between the two players. This allows the incite to stay healthy while not moving, maintaining the stack and effectiveness of chins. When there are 2 or more brothers that would be affected by chins, use chins. If you are targeting just one brother, use your dual crossbows or 2h bow. Positioning Where to stand is determined by the daily rotation, which changes everyday. On each side, three brothers spawn on three squares, spawning alphabetically North to South (A North, Z South). They will then aggro onto players, and the melee brothers will run to the players. Because the goal is to stack all brothers in chin radius, the strategy is generally to stand next to Ahrim or Karil and let the melee brothers run to you and stack on top of or next to Ahrim or Karil. Because AoE and stacking brothers is the most important part of getting efficient and fast kills, the incite should move as little as possible or else risk messing up the stack. When you need to move is determined by the daily rotation because each brother does different special attacks. Internalize the special attacks below then you can formulate your own plan of when to move based on the daily rotation. For instance, if it\u2019s ADG on one day, you would only move from the starting spot if: (1) Karil drops a bomb that could damage you or your partner, (2) Dharok or Guthan do a melee spin on your side, (3) Ahrim specs and becomes unattackable, at which point you should run the brothers to stop taking damage. Only move when you see one of these things happening: Dharok : The only Dharok spec that will force you to move is his melee spin. Guthan : Guthan can melee spin. Additionally, he can spear the DPS, at which point the DPS should move to stand MD of Guthan (if all brothers are stacked, as we don\u2019t want the Incite to move at all). Torag : The only Torag spec that will force you to move is his melee spin. Verac : Verac does not spin. Nothing Verac does should force you to move. Ahrim : Ahrim\u2019s firespin special attack can force you to move, but if you are immediately next to the rift in the center (as you are at the start of the fight), you won\u2019t take damage. Karil : Karil is the most dangerous brother. His lightning, bomb, and firespin attacks can all force you to move. \u200e \u200eHis firespin attack is the same as Ahrim\u2019s - if you are next to the rift, you will take no damage. His bomb attack can force you to move whether or not Karil is on your side. If he is on your side, you should move as soon as you realize he has started a bomb special because he leaves a bomb in his place when he hops over. If he is not on your side, you should be aware of Karil bombing and move away from the bombs. Keep in mind that you can be damaged by bombs on the other side of the rift - so if he bombs while you are still in your starting position, you may still need to move away. If you are low on food or it\u2019s shadow realm, you need to move quickly. Particular Rotations (Credit to @!206832972035260416 for the video guides) Notes \u2b25 If you have an offhand flanking you will need to 1 tick the switch in order to keep aftershock stacks. \u2b25 Because both players know what ability the other is doing at all times (at the start), the incite should walk both frag shots. They will need to walk under Ahrim in order to walk all three brothers\u2019 frag shots. For example, if it\u2019s A+2M (Ahrim plus two melee brothers), walk under Ahrim one tick after corrupting. \u2b25 Make sure your chins are hitting every brother. Chin abilities affect a 3x3 square centered around your target. That is, they will hit any enemy that is on or adjacent to the square you are targeting. Sometimes, brothers will spread around you and you will need to target the center brother instead of any brother that may be on the side. \u2b25 If meleeing you always want to start kills at 100% adrenaline and your adrenaline boosting potions are to be used after a kill ends to get you to 100%. (If you\u2019re at 75%+ use an . If you\u2019re at 60%-75%, use an . If you\u2019re below 60%, you want to place a dummy and build on it. Remember when doing this you can use defensives and still gain adrenaline while not next to the dummy. Ahrim + 2 Melee : Range: Auto \u2192 3t / (Activate as snipe/needle hits) \u2192 / \u2192 \u2192 Improvise Ahrim, because his name starts with A, will always start North. When there are two melee brothers combined with Ahrim, you should start the fight one square north of where he spawns if you are the the west side. On east side you should use the door method. If Ahrim is not aired and does a spec (very rare), the incite should start running the melee brothers to stall their attacks. \u200e \u200eRelure the brothers to Ahrim once he is done speccing. This is probably the second-easiest rotation of brothers behind Triple Melee. Examples can be seen here: East: https://youtu.be/9DQL7TEYQ00?t=121 West: https://youtu.be/9DQL7TEYQ00?t=275 Karil + 2 Melee : Range: Auto \u2192 3t / (Activate as snipe/needle hits) \u2192 \u2192 Improvise Melee: \u2192 (Activate ) Auto + \u2192 ( + ) \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 / \u2192 improvise When K is mid, the incite for this side will start the fight. The two players on this side should DD on top of where Karil spawns and force him to walk out from under you both by waiting one tick before autoing. If you don\u2019t start the fight on top of where Karil spawns, one of the brothers may end up behind you, and your chins won\u2019t impact him. \u200e \u200eAgain, if Karil specs, start running the melee brothers to stall their attacks and relure them ASAP onto Karil when he is attackable. Examples can be seen here: East: https://youtu.be/9DQL7TEYQ00?t=154 West: https://youtu.be/9DQL7TEYQ00?t=290 If K is south, the DPS stands 1 square south of where K would spawn and the incite starts the fight 1 square south of where the middle brother spaws. After starting the incite will DD on the DPS. Examples can be seen here: East: https://youtu.be/9DQL7TEYQ00?t=174 West: https://youtu.be/9DQL7TEYQ00?t=308 If K is north, the DPS stands 1 square north of where K would spawn and the incite starts the fight 1 square north of where the middle brother spawns. After starting the incite will DD on the DPS. Examples can be seen here: East: https://youtu.be/9DQL7TEYQ00?t=193 West: https://youtu.be/9DQL7TEYQ00?t=326 Triple Melee : Range: Auto \u2192 3t / (Activate as snipe/needle hits) \u2192 / \u2192 \u2192 Improvise Melee: (Activate ) Auto + \u2192 ( ) \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 / \u2192 improvise The 3M incite always starts the fight. The two players on this side should DD on top of where middle brother spawns. In order to prevent aggro onto the DPSer, It is recommended that the incite wait until after his first bleed (Corruption Shot) to start running. Examples can be seen here: East: https://youtu.be/9DQL7TEYQ00?t=249 West: https://youtu.be/9DQL7TEYQ00?t=390 AK (Middle) : Range (Incite): ( ) Auto + + \u2192 3t / \u2192 \u2192 Improvise Range (DPS): ( ) Auto + + \u2192 3t / \u2192 \u2192 Improvise With Karil as the middle brother it is possible to use the surge rotation on both west and east sides. This implies that you stand on the south most tile for east and 2nd southern-most square on west along the rift. Both players will target Karil then Auto + ability > surge (mid GCD) > chins + snipe > dbow > improvise. If you do not have a 9 tile range weapon you can do the intial auto + ability on the melee brother. Examples can be seen here: East: https://youtu.be/9DQL7TEYQ00?t=209 West: https://youtu.be/9DQL7TEYQ00?t=342 AK (South) : Start on the east tile infront of the door, after your Auto + bleed, walk one tile west. Ranged (east): Auto + / \u2192 3t / (Activate as snipe/needle hits) \u2192 \u2192 Improvise If you are west there is no effcient way to DD the brothers. The current meta is to DD north of Ahrim and finish Karil with high burst damage, then contunie on with the kill as normal. Ranged (west): Target Karil \u2192 Auto + 3t / (Activate as snipe/dazing hits) \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 Switch targets once Karil is dead and improvise Examples can be seen here: (Note the example for east rotation does not side step, however it is still recommended to do so) East: https://youtu.be/9DQL7TEYQ00?t=231 West: https://youtu.be/9DQL7TEYQ00?t=383 Miscellaneous Tips and Tricks 1. Kill priorities : Generally, the kill priority order goes Karil \u2192 Torag \u2192 Dharok \u2192 Guthan \u2192 Ahrim = Verac. With quad chinning, the kill order is not as important as it used to be. If there is ever an opportunity to chin brothers, do so (and when chinning you cannot control, really, which brother takes the most damage). However, if brothers are not stacked for some reason (e.g running from a spec), then this order becomes important. Karil is the highest priority target because his specs are the most dangerous and most damaging. Torag is next because his hammer spec has a lot of KO potential if it ever occurs simultaneously with any other spec (spin, bomb, lightning, etc). Dharok is next because he hits hard when low HP and can prolong a kill if he does a Give Me Everything special. Guthan is slightly less annoying than Dharok. Ahrim and Verac do very little damage and have mundane specials, so they are last. 2. How to keep track of Karil : Karil is relatively dangerous, and it is possible to die because you didn\u2019t see Karil leaving a bomb in the pile. The most consistent way to know where Karil is speccing is to watch for changes in the soul split animation. When Karil flies away to do a spec, the cloud-like animations that travel between the player and target will often track with him. By watching the clouds, you can know if and where Karil is speccing. If they suddenly fly towards somewhere on your side, he\u2019s probably doing a firespin. If they fly towards one of the pillars on the chasm, it\u2019s probably a lightning attack (might still be a bomb!). If they fly somewhere to the other side, you know it\u2019s a bomb. This tip is useful for people on and opposite of Karil\u2019s side. 3. Conserving food : \u2b25 Perfect your surges and bladed dives in the tunnels. \u2b25 Encourage your partners to save surge spots (see this guide: https://youtu.be/DpF579ZJP_Q ). \u2b25 Don\u2019t use Excalibur before you exit a tunnel as it will cancel on your way out. Instead, Excalibur in the surface world before you reenter a tunnel. \u2b25 Activate fortitude when you activate Excalibur. You\u2019ll heal about 30 more lp per Excalibur heal, and those extra lp will stick around after you deactivate fortitude. \u2b25 Most importantly, learn to avoid special attacks and kill the brothers quickly.

Both players stand on the same square (DD or death dot) and don\u2019t move unless necessary. Both players should activate their offensive range/melee prayer (Anguish/Desolation or Turmoil/Malevolance) and Soul Link. The incite should pray Protect from Melee and the DPS should pray Soul Split. The Soul Link curse splits both the damage and health healed from Soul Split between the two players. This allows the incite to stay healthy while not moving, maintaining the stack and effectiveness of chins. When there are 2 or more brothers that would be affected by chins, use chins. If you are targeting just one brother, use your dual crossbows or 2h bow.","title":"What to do"},{"location":"pvme-guides/high-tier-pvm/rots/#positioning","text":"Where to stand is determined by the daily rotation, which changes everyday. On each side, three brothers spawn on three squares, spawning alphabetically North to South (A North, Z South). They will then aggro onto players, and the melee brothers will run to the players. Because the goal is to stack all brothers in chin radius, the strategy is generally to stand next to Ahrim or Karil and let the melee brothers run to you and stack on top of or next to Ahrim or Karil. Because AoE and stacking brothers is the most important part of getting efficient and fast kills, the incite should move as little as possible or else risk messing up the stack. When you need to move is determined by the daily rotation because each brother does different special attacks. Internalize the special attacks below then you can formulate your own plan of when to move based on the daily rotation. For instance, if it\u2019s ADG on one day, you would only move from the starting spot if: (1) Karil drops a bomb that could damage you or your partner, (2) Dharok or Guthan do a melee spin on your side, (3) Ahrim specs and becomes unattackable, at which point you should run the brothers to stop taking damage. Only move when you see one of these things happening: Dharok : The only Dharok spec that will force you to move is his melee spin. Guthan : Guthan can melee spin. Additionally, he can spear the DPS, at which point the DPS should move to stand MD of Guthan (if all brothers are stacked, as we don\u2019t want the Incite to move at all). Torag : The only Torag spec that will force you to move is his melee spin. Verac : Verac does not spin. Nothing Verac does should force you to move. Ahrim : Ahrim\u2019s firespin special attack can force you to move, but if you are immediately next to the rift in the center (as you are at the start of the fight), you won\u2019t take damage. Karil : Karil is the most dangerous brother. His lightning, bomb, and firespin attacks can all force you to move. \u200e \u200eHis firespin attack is the same as Ahrim\u2019s - if you are next to the rift, you will take no damage. His bomb attack can force you to move whether or not Karil is on your side. If he is on your side, you should move as soon as you realize he has started a bomb special because he leaves a bomb in his place when he hops over. If he is not on your side, you should be aware of Karil bombing and move away from the bombs. Keep in mind that you can be damaged by bombs on the other side of the rift - so if he bombs while you are still in your starting position, you may still need to move away. If you are low on food or it\u2019s shadow realm, you need to move quickly.","title":"Positioning"},{"location":"pvme-guides/high-tier-pvm/rots/#particular-rotations-credit-to-amp64amp33amp50amp48amp54amp56amp51amp50amp57amp55amp50amp48amp51amp53amp50amp54amp48amp52amp49amp54-for-the-video-guides","text":"Notes \u2b25 If you have an offhand flanking you will need to 1 tick the switch in order to keep aftershock stacks. \u2b25 Because both players know what ability the other is doing at all times (at the start), the incite should walk both frag shots. They will need to walk under Ahrim in order to walk all three brothers\u2019 frag shots. For example, if it\u2019s A+2M (Ahrim plus two melee brothers), walk under Ahrim one tick after corrupting. \u2b25 Make sure your chins are hitting every brother. Chin abilities affect a 3x3 square centered around your target. That is, they will hit any enemy that is on or adjacent to the square you are targeting. Sometimes, brothers will spread around you and you will need to target the center brother instead of any brother that may be on the side. \u2b25 If meleeing you always want to start kills at 100% adrenaline and your adrenaline boosting potions are to be used after a kill ends to get you to 100%. (If you\u2019re at 75%+ use an . If you\u2019re at 60%-75%, use an . If you\u2019re below 60%, you want to place a dummy and build on it.

Ahrim + 2 Melee : Range: Auto \u2192 3t / (Activate as snipe/needle hits) \u2192 / \u2192 \u2192 Improvise Ahrim, because his name starts with A, will always start North. When there are two melee brothers combined with Ahrim, you should start the fight one square north of where he spawns if you are the the west side. On east side you should use the door method. If Ahrim is not aired and does a spec (very rare), the incite should start running the melee brothers to stall their attacks. \u200e \u200eRelure the brothers to Ahrim once he is done speccing. This is probably the second-easiest rotation of brothers behind Triple Melee. Examples can be seen here: East: https://youtu.be/9DQL7TEYQ00?t=121 West: https://youtu.be/9DQL7TEYQ00?t=275 Karil + 2 Melee : Range: Auto \u2192 3t / (Activate as snipe/needle hits) \u2192 \u2192 Improvise Melee: \u2192 (Activate ) Auto + \u2192 ( + ) \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 / \u2192 improvise When K is mid, the incite for this side will start the fight. The two players on this side should DD on top of where Karil spawns and force him to walk out from under you both by waiting one tick before autoing. If you don\u2019t start the fight on top of where Karil spawns, one of the brothers may end up behind you, and your chins won\u2019t impact him. \u200e \u200eAgain, if Karil specs, start running the melee brothers to stall their attacks and relure them ASAP onto Karil when he is attackable. Examples can be seen here: East: https://youtu.be/9DQL7TEYQ00?t=154 West: https://youtu.be/9DQL7TEYQ00?t=290 If K is south, the DPS stands 1 square south of where K would spawn and the incite starts the fight 1 square south of where the middle brother spaws.

The two players on this side should DD on top of where middle brother spawns.

This implies that you stand on the south most tile for east and 2nd southern-most square on west along the rift. Both players will target Karil then Auto + ability > surge (mid GCD) > chins + snipe > dbow > improvise.

Kill priorities : Generally, the kill priority order goes Karil \u2192 Torag \u2192 Dharok \u2192 Guthan \u2192 Ahrim = Verac. With quad chinning, the kill order is not as important as it used to be. If there is ever an opportunity to chin brothers, do so (and when chinning you cannot control, really, which brother takes the most damage). However, if brothers are not stacked for some reason (e.g running from a spec), then this order becomes important. Karil is the highest priority target because his specs are the most dangerous and most damaging. Torag is next because his hammer spec has a lot of KO potential if it ever occurs simultaneously with any other spec (spin, bomb, lightning, etc). Dharok is next because he hits hard when low HP and can prolong a kill if he does a Give Me Everything special. Guthan is slightly less annoying than Dharok. Ahrim and Verac do very little damage and have mundane specials, so they are last. 2. How to keep track of Karil : Karil is relatively dangerous, and it is possible to die because you didn\u2019t see Karil leaving a bomb in the pile. The most consistent way to know where Karil is speccing is to watch for changes in the soul split animation. When Karil flies away to do a spec, the cloud-like animations that travel between the player and target will often track with him. By watching the clouds, you can know if and where Karil is speccing. If they suddenly fly towards somewhere on your side, he\u2019s probably doing a firespin. If they fly towards one of the pillars on the chasm, it\u2019s probably a lightning attack (might still be a bomb!). If they fly somewhere to the other side, you know it\u2019s a bomb. This tip is useful for people on and opposite of Karil\u2019s side. 3. Conserving food : \u2b25 Perfect your surges and bladed dives in the tunnels. \u2b25 Encourage your partners to save surge spots (see this guide: https://youtu.be/DpF579ZJP_Q ). \u2b25 Don\u2019t use Excalibur before you exit a tunnel as it will cancel on your way out. Instead, Excalibur in the surface world before you reenter a tunnel. \u2b25 Activate fortitude when you activate Excalibur. You\u2019ll heal about 30 more lp per Excalibur heal, and those extra lp will stick around after you deactivate fortitude. \u2b25 Most importantly, learn to avoid special attacks and kill the brothers quickly.

The 7man version of this boss has 8M hp. Solak is the first boss that has made hybrid a viable strategy, which results in a lot of interesting ways to approach the fight, as well as a lot of different rotations. Whilst camping one style is not bad, utilizing two styles will yield the best results, as well as increase the killspeed overall, but mastering this can be a bit difficult. Recommended auras for this fight. You have 100% accuracy at Solak (except roots on p1) which means you should utilize other auras instead of the accuracy boosting ones. For hybrid, the best aura goes as follows: > > > For one style camping, the best aura to use would be the respective zerker aura ( / / ), and then the other hybrid auras as mentioned earlier If camping one style it is recommended to use magic as it gives you access to vulnerability and 4TAA. However, this guide will showcase a magic and a ranged non-hybrid 7man preset. If you\u2019re planning to melee you can just change the gear to match your own. Presets Non Hybrid 7man preset \u2022 Consider using a Grimoire if you own one, as there is no upkeep cost to using it at Solak \u2022 Cinderbanes are BiS at Solak (even for range), as Solak is poisonable, this stacks with weapon poison \u2022 The 4 mines are essentially 40k damage on the roots, making you spend less time on them and enabling you to get back on Solak quickly \u2022 Switches are not necessary but highly encouraged, as they increase your DPS. Change preset accordingly to what you feel comfortable with. They are not extremely important if you are basing, although will help with clearing some mechanics of the fight. Hybrid 7man preset This preset is just a sample preset for maximum efficiency, but can be changed accordingly dependent on the person. This preset can be changed depending on whether you\u2019re basing or not. Note: A grimoire is the BiS pocket slot item for hybrid. An update made it such that grimoire no longer has upkeep at Solak, therefore this is always the best option. Pre-fight Build to 100% adrenaline outside of the arena Start by placing two of your mines at the southmost root spawns, three DPSers on each side (base can choose whichever side) Prior to the fight, you must discuss which root you will be taking, it can be any root except the two most southern ones. You must place your mines on the same tick otherwise only one will go off. Phase 1 First we\u2019ll go over the attack rotation, and then into detail on how to deal with them accordingly. Solak P1 attack rotation 2 Autos Green pads 3 Autos Auto + Bomb explodes as your bar fills up + root will spawn around the arena 8 Autos Stunning roots will spawn on two players that have to run - avoid pking team members 7 Autos AoE blight bomb 7 Autos AoE Blight bomb 3 Autos Arms -> Legs Core 7 Autos Arms -> Legs Core This is the end of a normal P1, but this can vary depending on team members and skill level. P1 fight breakdown Solak has 8 million hp. You are expected to finish your sunshine/death swiftness/berserk before getting onto roots. The lower Solaks hp is on p1 before root spawn, the better. This will increase the chance of skipping a second root spawn (will get to this later). Roots are flankable from the North side. Use your second set of dominion mines on the roots, as they\u2019ll deal 20k damage to one of them. After initial boss start, green pads will spawn. After this attack, finish your ultimates and go to your respective root. During this root attack, two random playes will get a deadly root that will stun and deal rapid 2k damage to anyone standing ontop of them. You have anywhere between 7 to 13 seconds to deal with this. This is completely random. To deal with this attack, surge/bladed dive to the arrow that spawns with the root, use freedom and run out a second or two before root spawn. Make sure no one is standing on top of the roots. After this attack, everyone should get back on Solak. Make sure every root is dead, otherwise blight lashers will spawn, dealing 2k+ range damage per hit. Get back on Solak, your goal now is to get Solak as low as possible, to ensure no repetition of p1 specs. Solak will spawn three blight bombs on random DPSers. He will do this twice. After the second blight bomb, he will phase into his arms, which both have around 120k hp. Once these have been dealt with, he will phase into legs. After the legs, a blight core will spawn with 1 million hp. Deal as much damage to this as possible. Depending on whether you\u2019re hybrid or camping one style, use berserk or your respective style ultimate and deal as much damage possible to the core. Phase one will end once the core is dead. Note: The dps threshold for 7man Solak on P1 is 6M hp It is possible to repeat every p1 mechanic, if phase hp is not met after first core. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- The rotation will restart from green pads until phase hp as been met, after that, you have to deal with arms/legs until core is dead. If at any point Solak reaches 6M HP, his next attack will be the arms/legs. This is why it is crucial to do as much damage as possible on P1 It is possible to skip blight bombs P1 if you hit the DPS threshold (6M hp) before the bombs. Using bladed dive on a pad resets the cooldown of it, enabling you to use it again Phase 2 Solak P2 attack rotation Eruptions Anima bombs (weak at first but hits progressively harder at the end) (alongside anima bombs, Solak will do 12 autos before doing next mechanic) Blight rain (5 hits) (alongside this rain, Solak will do 7 autoattacks) Pulling root attack Blight rain (5 hits) Hurricane Roots x2 (alongside blighbombs, kind of how it works on p1) Blight rain (5 hits) (Solaks attack rotation will go back to anima bomb and repeat every mechanic in p2 except eruptions) P2 fight breakdown: As DPS: Surge southwest as the core dies. Every team member should be killing the southwest eruption. Merethiel should be clickable now. As soon as you can, cleanse on merethiel, activate the cleansing mechanic whilst killing the eruption. As the eruption dies, cleanse at merethiel, and then surge back to the dead eruption. Utilize surge and bladed dive as much as possible. (NOTE: Some experienced teams will have a designated NW role on p2, all this role does is kill the NW eruption and attack solak, and nothing else.) Do NOT miss a cleanse, as this can seriously damage your team depending on how severe the damage on the blightstorm is. Remember to let your team know if you\u2019ve missed the blight. As eruptions die, every dpser should go to the most northern stairs in the arena This spot is least likely to get hit by bombs but do keep in mind that bombs can STILL hit here. When the anima bomb attack is over, Solak will prepare to do his blight rain. One dpser grabs the nature blessing (yellow shield dome) and places it when solak puts his hands down. Solak will deal hard hitting blight damage outside the dome (around 7-8k) So its important that you STAY inside the dome, as his damage will be reduced greatly. Solak will do his pulling root attack, stunning and binding one random member of the team, and instakilling them if they do not move out of his attack. This attack can be easily avoided if you use freedom and move away. You can also use anticipation prior to the attack, to avoid it completely. During this attack, depending on your role in P3 (We will get into this later in the guide) you will use either berserk or Sunshine/Deaths\u2019 swiftness (only for HYBRID). If you\u2019re style camping, disregard this completely. After this attack, he will use his blight rain attack again. Deal with it the same way. This is where the fight can vary for a lot of people. A fast team will either phase before the blight rain or during the blight rain. For slower teams, you will encounter the hurricane mechanic, which can easily decimate the team if you are not prepared. If your corruption percentage under solaks hp is still fairly high during second blight rain, quickly build to the barricade ability. As Solak is about to do his hurricane mechanic, quickly use barricade to block all damage. The following mechanics should never happen, no matter team but I decided to put them in anyways in case some teams lose a lot of members and for some reason decide to continue. Solak will do a blight bomb similar to his P1, but will also place some roots in front of him, however these are very easy to avoid, as you can just walk behind Solak. He will do this twice before doing his third rain attack, after this he will repeat all his mechanics except his eruption mechanic. As Base: Basing is a bit different. On P2 Start, instead of going south with the DPSers, you want to go NE and kill the eruption alone. Once eruption is dead, attack solak again. It is important that you line solak up so the DPSers can flank it. This is very easy for you, as all the dpsers will stand north at the stairs, so you can stand south of them with Solak. As base, you will have to avoid anima bombs a bit more frequent. Remember to not run completely off with Solak, as this could pull team members with you, and killing them in the process. During the blight rain, the base will grab and place his own nature blessing (yellow shield dome) to let DPSers flank Solak. When Solak does his pulling root attack, he will place his arm on the ground. The base will climb on this arm (still dpsing solak) and take a huge melee hit that hits around 8k. This is a melee hit that you can use resonance or devotion on. The rest of the fight is the same for dps and base, with another blight rain and hurricane. Note \u2022 The moment you hit 0% corruption, P3 will start. \u2022 The rotation will restart from anima bombs if not at 0% corruption \u2022 You CAN resonance the hurricane and blight rain hits, although you have to time the blight rain hit res, as a range hit will hit just before the blight rain hit. \u2022 If on a slow team and you struggle with phasing before hurricane, you can shatter during arm climbing.","title":"Solak 7s"},{"location":"pvme-guides/high-tier-pvm/solak-7s/#solak-7s","text":"Solak - 7-man Perspective","title":"Solak 7s"},{"location":"pvme-guides/high-tier-pvm/solak-7s/#introduction","text":"The most recently released major boss in RuneScape 3, Solak, has a duo and a 7man version that scales accordingly.

Depending on whether you\u2019re hybrid or camping one style, use berserk or your respective style ultimate and deal as much damage possible to the core. Phase one will end once the core is dead. Note: The dps threshold for 7man Solak on P1 is 6M hp It is possible to repeat every p1 mechanic, if phase hp is not met after first core. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- The rotation will restart from green pads until phase hp as been met, after that, you have to deal with arms/legs until core is dead. If at any point Solak reaches 6M HP, his next attack will be the arms/legs. This is why it is crucial to do as much damage as possible on P1 It is possible to skip blight bombs P1 if you hit the DPS threshold (6M hp) before the bombs. Using bladed dive on a pad resets the cooldown of it, enabling you to use it again","title":"Phase 1"},{"location":"pvme-guides/high-tier-pvm/solak-7s/#phase-2","text":"Solak P2 attack rotation Eruptions Anima bombs (weak at first but hits progressively harder at the end) (alongside anima bombs, Solak will do 12 autos before doing next mechanic) Blight rain (5 hits) (alongside this rain, Solak will do 7 autoattacks) Pulling root attack Blight rain (5 hits) Hurricane Roots x2 (alongside blighbombs, kind of how it works on p1) Blight rain (5 hits) (Solaks attack rotation will go back to anima bomb and repeat every mechanic in p2 except eruptions) P2 fight breakdown: As DPS: Surge southwest as the core dies. Every team member should be killing the southwest eruption. Merethiel should be clickable now. As soon as you can, cleanse on merethiel, activate the cleansing mechanic whilst killing the eruption. As the eruption dies, cleanse at merethiel, and then surge back to the dead eruption. Utilize surge and bladed dive as much as possible. (NOTE: Some experienced teams will have a designated NW role on p2, all this role does is kill the NW eruption and attack solak, and nothing else.) Do NOT miss a cleanse, as this can seriously damage your team depending on how severe the damage on the blightstorm is. Remember to let your team know if you\u2019ve missed the blight. As eruptions die, every dpser should go to the most northern stairs in the arena This spot is least likely to get hit by bombs but do keep in mind that bombs can STILL hit here. When the anima bomb attack is over, Solak will prepare to do his blight rain. One dpser grabs the nature blessing (yellow shield dome) and places it when solak puts his hands down. Solak will deal hard hitting blight damage outside the dome (around 7-8k) So its important that you STAY inside the dome, as his damage will be reduced greatly. Solak will do his pulling root attack, stunning and binding one random member of the team, and instakilling them if they do not move out of his attack. This attack can be easily avoided if you use freedom and move away. You can also use anticipation prior to the attack, to avoid it completely. During this attack, depending on your role in P3 (We will get into this later in the guide) you will use either berserk or Sunshine/Deaths\u2019 swiftness (only for HYBRID). If you\u2019re style camping, disregard this completely. After this attack, he will use his blight rain attack again. Deal with it the same way. This is where the fight can vary for a lot of people. A fast team will either phase before the blight rain or during the blight rain. For slower teams, you will encounter the hurricane mechanic, which can easily decimate the team if you are not prepared. If your corruption percentage under solaks hp is still fairly high during second blight rain, quickly build to the barricade ability. As Solak is about to do his hurricane mechanic, quickly use barricade to block all damage. The following mechanics should never happen, no matter team but I decided to put them in anyways in case some teams lose a lot of members and for some reason decide to continue. Solak will do a blight bomb similar to his P1, but will also place some roots in front of him, however these are very easy to avoid, as you can just walk behind Solak. He will do this twice before doing his third rain attack, after this he will repeat all his mechanics except his eruption mechanic. As Base: Basing is a bit different. On P2 Start, instead of going south with the DPSers, you want to go NE and kill the eruption alone. Once eruption is dead, attack solak again. It is important that you line solak up so the DPSers can flank it. This is very easy for you, as all the dpsers will stand north at the stairs, so you can stand south of them with Solak. As base, you will have to avoid anima bombs a bit more frequent. Remember to not run completely off with Solak, as this could pull team members with you, and killing them in the process. During the blight rain, the base will grab and place his own nature blessing (yellow shield dome) to let DPSers flank Solak. When Solak does his pulling root attack, he will place his arm on the ground. The base will climb on this arm (still dpsing solak) and take a huge melee hit that hits around 8k. This is a melee hit that you can use resonance or devotion on. The rest of the fight is the same for dps and base, with another blight rain and hurricane. Note \u2022 The moment you hit 0% corruption, P3 will start. \u2022 The rotation will restart from anima bombs if not at 0% corruption \u2022 You CAN resonance the hurricane and blight rain hits, although you have to time the blight rain hit res, as a range hit will hit just before the blight rain hit. \u2022 If on a slow team and you struggle with phasing before hurricane, you can shatter during arm climbing.","title":"Phase 2"},{"location":"pvme-guides/high-tier-pvm/solak-duo/","text":"Solak duo Solak - Duo Perspective (Courtesy of @319736938020208640 and @200393357623689216 ) Introduction Solak can be found in The Lost Grove.

Phase 1 Solak Attack Rotation 2 Autos \u2192 Green pads \u2192 3 Autos \u2192 Bombs explode & roots spawn \u2192 13 Autos \u2192 Roots \u2192 7 Autos \u2192 Blight bomb \u2192 7 Autos \u2192 Blight bomb \u2192 3 Autos \u2192 Arms and Legs \u2192 Core \u2192 7 Autos Note: The rotation will restart from green pads until core is dead. If at any point Solak reaches 2.25 million health, his next spec will go straight into arms and legs Phase 1 Rundown Base will start the fight and be hit with melee attacks while the DPS will be hit with range attacks. Both zerk+apot, base usually reprisals, throws vulnbomb and then starts. Optimally both players will bd to the pad more suitable for them and back on the next tick. If this is not possible stalling an ability is a good option for the dpser. There are a few ways to deal with the bomb from the green pads: \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- The recommended method is to use disruption shield. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Resonance: This will fully negate the bomb\u2019s damage at only the cost of a GCD. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- The melee hit will hit before the bomb damage, so don\u2019t accidentally resonance/disrupt the melee hit. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Depending on how far away you are from Solak, the bomb will hit before the range attack. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Debilitate/Reflect. There are much better ways to use your adrenaline, but this is a safe method. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Tank it. You will take maximum ~8k with zerk aura, reduced depending on proximity to your partner. After your zerk runs out, use zgs spec and continue dpsing until 2.25 million hp. Sunshine west of the circle in the middle of the arena then move on to the roots starting at the northernmost one on your side. After your zerk you want to lure Solak to the northeast/northwest roots depending where you placed your mines pre-fight. After luring Solak to the roots the base will sun on 2nd northern-most root and the Dpser will sun on the root north of the base. After the base's bleeds run out the dpser will voke and use their own bleeds allowing both to use bleeds and flanking. Place your extra two mines at 2 different roots, after Solak is capped. Any roots left alive will turn into Blightbound Lashers. More than 1 lasher will be a problem but having 1 during the core is tankable. More experienced teams will skip the arrow roots and Solak will go into the arms phase at 1:06 on the time. Communicate with your partner your root attack spawn and spend as little time not attacking Solak as possible. DPS should res the first anima bomb to heal the damage and tank the second. You'll \u200e \u200eall of your health back on arms and legs. If you are camping mage and Solak is still relatively high hp, sun as late into legs as possible to have your sun carry through after core to help get root skip. If both are hybriding, one person offs early on legs and the kills the last lag to get a better berserk making 1cycle likely. When the legs are low hp, zerk + barge to finish the leg and get the gbarge effect. Finish the core then run south for the next phase. Phase 2 Phase 2 Rotation Eruptions \u2192 Anima Bombs \u2192 12 Autos \u2192 Blight rain \u2192 7 Autos \u2192 Binding Crush \u2192 4 Autos \u2192 Blight rain \u2192 7 Autos \u2192 Hurricane \u2192 7 Autos \u2192 Roots \u2192 4 Autos \u2192 Blight bomb \u2192 3 Autos \u2192 Blight bomb \u2192 4 Autos \u2192 Blight rain Note: Reach 0% corruption to begin phase 3 The rotation will restart from anima bombs if not at 0% corruption Phase 2 Rundown Surge Southwest as the core dies and build adrenaline with defensives. Kill the southwest eruption and with your 3rd ability tag merethiel After tagging merethiel both bladed dive and do 2 abilties on southeast eruption and run into the cleanse. After getting the cleanse surge west and go up from the first eruption and click the storm. When you come down pray melee because Solak will sometimes switch aggro and you can react to the range attacks. After coming down southeast should be dead. If this is not the case the dpser should go and kill it solo while the bases goes north and kills both eruptions. The total amount of cleanses for the storm to die quickly is 3 times. if you go 4 times up total the storm will die before you go down. (base+dps up=2) If slow dps or one person missed cleanse, cleanse and adapt how you go up. Optimally somewhere during eruptions the dpser will calory bomb solak so that you can skip the 2nd rain. However if there isn't a suitable opportunity for that, doing it before or after 1st rain is fine. After eruptions, base will stand in the northernmost part of the arena, and DPS will stand behind Solak to utilize flanking. Both berserk+apot into sun into zgs. The anima bombs do increased damage the later into the phase it goes, so dodging the first couple bombs is not as crucial. The later bombs can easily KO you with up to 8k hits. If you are constantly skipping the third rain, both players can drop a shield on the first rain to allow DPS to utilize flanking. If you are not skipping the third rain just group up under one shield, it is still possible to flank even if both are under the same shield While under the effects of the shield, the blight rain does ~2k damage per hit. Stepping out of the shield and resonance one hit of the rain should put you back to full health. Be wary of a range auto sniping your res. Freedom so you will not be dragged out of sun when Solak begins his binding attack. Base will run up Solak\u2019s arm to deal a vicious blow. You can soulsplit all of your health back during the binding attack. When base returns to the ground they will receive a hefty melee attack. This hit is usually resonanced but can also be tanked with melee prayer. Phase 3 Solak Attack Rotation 2 Autos \u2192 Blight bomb \u2192 3 Autos \u2192 Stun and bleed \u2192 Open mind \u2192 Repeat until all relics are charged or Erethdor is killed Phase 3 Rundown Solak\u2019s hp cap is 300k in duo. It is not worth killing Erethdor unless you are hitting cap by four charged relics. If not killing the elf, just sun as often as possible and charge each relic. Blight bombs will occasionally drop onto relics, and bombs will always drop onto a freshly charged relic. These bombs do 2k typeless and add two blight stacks. Freedom/anticipate before Solak\u2019s stun and bleed. In duo, only one person has to stun Solak to cleanse the bleed, so there should be minimal bleed damage. If you are still not at hp cap before the last relic, you can stall and just dps Solak. When killing Erethdor, sunshine right at the first relic. Continue to dps inside sunshine and begin charging the second relic. Be at 100% adrenaline when the second relic is charged. After the second relic is charged base enters the mind realm followed by the DPS to ensure base has Solak\u2019s aggro when kicked out of the realm. One person tags with vuln walked combust and both players berserk. DPS vokes Erethdor off base to ensure base is not taking a range bleed when exiting the realm. If Erethdor is still relatively high hp, DPS can enter the realm after charging the third relic to just threshold Erethdor down to a lower hp. Continue to dps Solak down to 300k health while charging fonts to allow more time to soulsplit. Once Solak is about to hp cap, enter the realm and finish off Erethdor. End phase 3 with 100% adrenaline. Phase 4 (Base) Phase 4 Base Rundown Position North of Solak to utilize flanking. Natural Instinct and build back to 100% adren with defensives/weak abilities while Solak is immune to damage. At 100% adrenaline Metamorphosis, bleeds, dragon breath, and flanking. Try to get at least wild magic and asphyx off before entering the realm. Enter the mind with ~50% adrenaline just before the blight bomb explodes. Pray mage and tag all of the manifestations. Caroming can help here by tagging up to six manifestations at once. Reflect and devotion when you are about to die. When devotion is about to run out, barricade and heal Solak by clicking on him along with still tagging manifestations. No realming base should have at least 59% entering p4 If high adren can use blood tendrils and dismember before zerk zerk+apot bleed destroy, base shatters. Phase 4 (DPS) Phase 4 DPS Rundown Position North of Solak to utilize flanking. Natural Instinct and build back to 100% adren with defensives/weak abilities while Solak is immune to damage. At 100% adrenaline Sunshine, make sure to NOT override your base\u2019s boosted bleeds. Asphyx into wild magic.

Either stand outside the max range setting on your TC from Solak, or TC his body and TC a 2nd time to target the core when it spawns \u2b25 If you use a 2h auto+abil to kill the leg, your auto attack will be on cooldown and you will be unable to vuln the core the tick it spawns with TC. You can still tag normally via clicking if the leg died to a delayed ability (Sonic Wave), or the auto attack. Arms+Legs: If choosing to mage the arms and legs, try to use Sunshine before he caps p1 and phases into arms+legs (1:26 or so if skipping both blights) Ideally, you should prioritise AoE abilities on arms and legs and flank from the north side. Arms can be AoE'd with Chain and Dbreath As the West arm is south of the East arm, the spot to dbreath both arms from is here (Use the dirt circle as a landmark, it is a 3x3 square and the double dbreath spot is the East square): Legs can be AoE'd with Chain, Dbreath, Deto (must be 100% for additional range), using a scythe as meleecamp allows you to cleave both legs as well as quake and hurricane (not recommended as meleecampers likely will use destroy as 1st threshold on core) No realm: The timing to barge solak before he's vulnerable can be gauged, you should be barging as he flies back from Merethiel (Assuming the animation does not glitch out for you) Example Video: https://youtu.be/nbZUoHz_f2Y Both players should cancel their and + when Solak reaches 40k hp as that will likely kill the boss instantly (Shatter will hit 30k with 7 shards in zerk, use the time at the start of p4 to add 2 more shards) Some spreadsheets courtesy of @385968877823328276 https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kEIa8-oDbwJi16c8pnBEEbEd2VTeOxocap7mVHU_N6Q/edit https://docs.google.com/document/d/1x3KrSKmWz93lTJhfOK9rXZFh0VsfzZcUajF2An6HP9w/edit","title":"Solak duo"},{"location":"pvme-guides/high-tier-pvm/solak-duo/#solak-duo","text":"Solak - Duo Perspective (Courtesy of @319736938020208640 and @200393357623689216 )","title":"Solak duo"},{"location":"pvme-guides/high-tier-pvm/solak-duo/#introduction","text":"Solak can be found in The Lost Grove.

However if there isn't a suitable opportunity for that, doing it before or after 1st rain is fine. After eruptions, base will stand in the northernmost part of the arena, and DPS will stand behind Solak to utilize flanking. Both berserk+apot into sun into zgs. The anima bombs do increased damage the later into the phase it goes, so dodging the first couple bombs is not as crucial. The later bombs can easily KO you with up to 8k hits. If you are constantly skipping the third rain, both players can drop a shield on the first rain to allow DPS to utilize flanking. If you are not skipping the third rain just group up under one shield, it is still possible to flank even if both are under the same shield While under the effects of the shield, the blight rain does ~2k damage per hit. Stepping out of the shield and resonance one hit of the rain should put you back to full health. Be wary of a range auto sniping your res. Freedom so you will not be dragged out of sun when Solak begins his binding attack. Base will run up Solak\u2019s arm to deal a vicious blow. You can soulsplit all of your health back during the binding attack. When base returns to the ground they will receive a hefty melee attack. This hit is usually resonanced but can also be tanked with melee prayer. Phase 3 Solak Attack Rotation 2 Autos \u2192 Blight bomb \u2192 3 Autos \u2192 Stun and bleed \u2192 Open mind \u2192 Repeat until all relics are charged or Erethdor is killed Phase 3 Rundown Solak\u2019s hp cap is 300k in duo. It is not worth killing Erethdor unless you are hitting cap by four charged relics. If not killing the elf, just sun as often as possible and charge each relic. Blight bombs will occasionally drop onto relics, and bombs will always drop onto a freshly charged relic. These bombs do 2k typeless and add two blight stacks. Freedom/anticipate before Solak\u2019s stun and bleed. In duo, only one person has to stun Solak to cleanse the bleed, so there should be minimal bleed damage. If you are still not at hp cap before the last relic, you can stall and just dps Solak. When killing Erethdor, sunshine right at the first relic. Continue to dps inside sunshine and begin charging the second relic. Be at 100% adrenaline when the second relic is charged. After the second relic is charged base enters the mind realm followed by the DPS to ensure base has Solak\u2019s aggro when kicked out of the realm. One person tags with vuln walked combust and both players berserk. DPS vokes Erethdor off base to ensure base is not taking a range bleed when exiting the realm. If Erethdor is still relatively high hp, DPS can enter the realm after charging the third relic to just threshold Erethdor down to a lower hp. Continue to dps Solak down to 300k health while charging fonts to allow more time to soulsplit. Once Solak is about to hp cap, enter the realm and finish off Erethdor. End phase 3 with 100% adrenaline. Phase 4 (Base) Phase 4 Base Rundown Position North of Solak to utilize flanking. Natural Instinct and build back to 100% adren with defensives/weak abilities while Solak is immune to damage. At 100% adrenaline Metamorphosis, bleeds, dragon breath, and flanking. Try to get at least wild magic and asphyx off before entering the realm. Enter the mind with ~50% adrenaline just before the blight bomb explodes. Pray mage and tag all of the manifestations. Caroming can help here by tagging up to six manifestations at once. Reflect and devotion when you are about to die. When devotion is about to run out, barricade and heal Solak by clicking on him along with still tagging manifestations. No realming base should have at least 59% entering p4 If high adren can use blood tendrils and dismember before zerk zerk+apot bleed destroy, base shatters. Phase 4 (DPS) Phase 4 DPS Rundown Position North of Solak to utilize flanking. Natural Instinct and build back to 100% adren with defensives/weak abilities while Solak is immune to damage. At 100% adrenaline Sunshine, make sure to NOT override your base\u2019s boosted bleeds. Asphyx into wild magic. Build back to 100% to berserk and kill it before it kills you. ~~ 1-cycle core Rotation (vulnerability) ~~ (Outdated) \u2192 \u2192 leg \u2192 Target core \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 2 Hit \u2192 \u2192 1-cycle core Rotation (no vuln) \u2192 \u2192 leg \u2192 Target core \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 3?

Either stand outside the max range setting on your TC from Solak, or TC his body and TC a 2nd time to target the core when it spawns \u2b25 If you use a 2h auto+abil to kill the leg, your auto attack will be on cooldown and you will be unable to vuln the core the tick it spawns with TC. You can still tag normally via clicking if the leg died to a delayed ability (Sonic Wave), or the auto attack. Arms+Legs: If choosing to mage the arms and legs, try to use Sunshine before he caps p1 and phases into arms+legs (1:26 or so if skipping both blights) Ideally, you should prioritise AoE abilities on arms and legs and flank from the north side. Arms can be AoE'd with Chain and Dbreath As the West arm is south of the East arm, the spot to dbreath both arms from is here (Use the dirt circle as a landmark, it is a 3x3 square and the double dbreath spot is the East square): Legs can be AoE'd with Chain, Dbreath, Deto (must be 100% for additional range), using a scythe as meleecamp allows you to cleave both legs as well as quake and hurricane (not recommended as meleecampers likely will use destroy as 1st threshold on core) No realm: The timing to barge solak before he's vulnerable can be gauged, you should be barging as he flies back from Merethiel (Assuming the animation does not glitch out for you) Example Video: https://youtu.be/nbZUoHz_f2Y Both players should cancel their and + when Solak reaches 40k hp as that will likely kill the boss instantly (Shatter will hit 30k with 7 shards in zerk, use the time at the start of p4 to add 2 more shards) Some spreadsheets courtesy of @385968877823328276 https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kEIa8-oDbwJi16c8pnBEEbEd2VTeOxocap7mVHU_N6Q/edit https://docs.google.com/document/d/1x3KrSKmWz93lTJhfOK9rXZFh0VsfzZcUajF2An6HP9w/edit","title":"Presets"},{"location":"pvme-guides/high-tier-pvm/telos-0-999/","text":"Telos 0 999 Telos (Courtesy of @!319736938020208640 , @!162317885044293632 and @!425520655920791553 ) Introduction Telos, the Warden is the true guardian of the Heart of Gielinor. Telos is a solo boss that can only be fought after obtaining the four parts of an ancient sigil from the four other bosses in the Heart (requiring 80 attack, prayer, magic, and range). Telos is regarded as the most profitable boss currently once a player is able to consistently kill and streak high enrages. Telos drops t92 two-hand weapons consisting of the Staff of Sliske, Zaros Godsword, and Seren Godbow. Telos has a unique looting mechanic where players can choose to risk the drops from a kill for increased chance of better loot at the cost of a more difficult fight known as streaking. Each kill players choose to forgo claiming the loot increases enrage between 5-20%. As enrage increases, mechanics are added to the fight as well as every mistake being much more punishing. A successful kill at 500% enrage unlocks the green Warden title, a successful kill at 2000% enrage unlocks the silver Warden title, and enrage is capped at 4000% where a successful kill will unlock the golden Warden title. On phases 1 and 2, Telos will attack with melee unless players are out of range. When out of range, Telos will shoot off a magic attack and move into melee distance again. Phase 3 is only magic auto attacks. On phase 4, the only difference with autos from phases 1 and 2 is when players are out of range, Telos will continue to use magic autos rather than move into melee range. Phase 5, Telos will only use magic auto attacks. Presets \u2b25 Beginner Telos Weapon Poison one dose should be used in conjunction with cinderbanes to rack up damage. An arcane is used for if you get into sticky situations, as the damage reduction can be life saving. Dreadnips can be used for stuns. A wand should be used for p5 if shield camping is needed. A Guthix Staff is used for its special attack, and the nox staff will be used for most DPSing. \u2b25 Advanced Telos Rune pouches are used to take advantage of ancients spells, allowing for breaking freedom and passive healing + AoE on golems, in addition to using disruption shield to null big hits like SMP. Switches are used for 4taa, nips are no longer used as they can cause unnecessary stalls, cause telos to get stuck in the beam and ruin freedom timing. Rest remains as above, simply with upgraded food available. \u2b25 \u200e \u200e Rune Pouch \u2b25 \u200e \u200e Rune Pouch \u2b25 \u200e \u200e Rune Pouch (Runes for ) Enrage Mechanics 50% Virus is added on P2 and P3 100% Phase 5 150% Telos will freedom stuns and binds with a 50 tick cooldown 200% Telos hp caps at 600,000 on P1-4 250% Telos will freedom stuns and binds with a 31 tick cooldown, and P5 will be stun-immunes after freedom for 10 ticks 300% Telos hp caps at 200,000 on P5 500% P4 font hp caps at 10,000 1000% P4 a rock will fall, P5 multiple rocks will fall, immortality no longer works P5, and Telos will freedom stuns and binds with a 16 tick cooldown 2700% Tendrils damage required caps at 30,000 4000% Hard enrage cap Telos Phasing Diagram Note: There was most likely intention of being another special attack but was scrapped, and some spaghetti code leads to Telos just standing there delaying his autos for a tick. This will be referred to as a No Spec. Phasing after Hold Still or Virus P2 will lead to a No Spec first P3. Telos will do 7 auto attacks, stall for a tick, 3 more auto attacks, and Uppercut. Phasing P3 before the No Spec will lead to a No Spec first P4. Telos will do 3 auto attacks, stall for a tick, and Hold Still. Target Cycling at Telos Target cycling can be used to tag earlier on phase 1 and phase 5. Phase 5 is simple - just target cycle as soon as you see Telos' head pop up, or as soon as you see the yellow dot on the minimap. Your target range must be set to max for this to work. For phase 1, you need to trigger gcd (using devo) wait 2 ticks then surge in (off gcd) and sun on the next tick. Wait 3 ticks then target cycle + abil. Be aware that if your first abil splashes, it can cause Telos' first auto to hit 2 ticks earlier. https://youtu.be/h1v5kS9I50w Phase 1 \u2b25 Mechanics 7 Autos \u2192 Tendrils \u2192 3 Autos \u2192 Uppercut \u2192 3 Autos \u2192 Hold Still \u2192 3 Autos \u2192 Repeat from tendrils until phased \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 On P1, a green beam will spawn on telos and then stay for 20 ticks. If stood in the beam the player will gain 10% adrenaline per tick, and their prayer points will be drained slightly, scaling with enrage. While Telos stands in the beam, his attack speed will increase from four ticks per attack to three ticks per attack and his special bar will fill. If his special bar fills on P1, Telos will fire off a So Much Power in place of his next special. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 The Tendrils special will require you to deal 3,000 + 10 \u00d7 Enrage damage, and Telos will also heal himself while channeling this special. Telos also drains your adrenaline while channeling this spec so it's important to clear it quickly. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- You should aim to use a high damage ability like dragonbreath, wild magic or guthix staff spec to cancel this. As enrage goes up it becomes increasingly important to stack damage properly, so it's recommended to use as these will all hit on the same tick. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Surge , escape , or bladed dive away from the Uppercut 1t after the dialogue window disappears. The timing of avoiding this attack will come with practice. Players must be at least three squares away from their original position to not get hit. Players can also resonance or disruption shield to negate the typeless damage, but this is not recommended because these are better used on other specials. \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Use Freedom or Anticipate \u200e \u200ebefore Hold Still to avoid the stun, equip wand and shield, and Resonance \u200e \u200ethe big melee hit, but be careful not to resonance the attack that comes right before the actual damage. Devotion and Deflect Melee is another way to avoid the damage. Move three squares away to avoid the stomp. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- If you forget to freedom/anticipate, you can manually click your shield in your inventory and spam resonance to negate the stomp hit. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Continue to dps and deal with mechanics until phase hp. In general you want to be phasing either immediately after the first tendrils, or even before. This will depend on enrage, gear and skill though. \u2b25 Rotations (250%-999%) (Courtesy of @198930220663701504 ; faster rot, can skip Deep Impact) \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 (3-hit) \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u200e \u200e (3t) \u2192 \u200e \u200e\u2192 (if high hp \u2192 \u200e \u200e\u2192 ) \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e[Old Rotations: https://i.imgur.com/v7ncL5c.png ] (Courtesy of @425520655920791553 ; more consistent rot) \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 (3-hit) > \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u200e \u200e \u2192 (3t) \u2192 \u2192 It is worth noting that a more consistent P1 will lead to a more consistent P2, which is very helpful, especially while learning. Phase 2 \u2b25 Mechanics The first spec will depend on what spec was last used on P1, and how soon it happens depends on how many autos are left (max of three). Refer to spec order image. Assuming phase after tendrils and before uppercut. (3-auto attacks after last spec on P1) auto attacks \u2192 Magic Onslaught \u2192 3 Autos \u2192 Hold Still \u2192 3 Autos \u2192 Virus (if 50%+ enrage; uppercut if <50%) \u2192 3 Autos \u2192 Uppercut \u2192 3 Autos \u2192 Tendrils \u2192 3 Autos \u2192 Repeat from Magic Onslaught until phase hp \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 On P2 a black beam spawns on Telos and stays for 33 ticks. While players stand in the beam, they take and deal 30% reduced damage. While Telos stands in the beam, his special bar will fill and he will take 20% less damage. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Telos will fire off Magic Onslaught hits until his bar is empty. He cannot be moved during this, so if he is standing in the beam, players must block the beam to negate the bar filling. Devotion and Deflect Mage the orange/red attacks if his bar was relatively full before the attack started. Other damage reducing abilities (debilitate and reflect ) will also reduce the damage taken. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 The virus damage is negligible at low enrages, but it can really cut into your food if not dealt with quickly at higher enrages so you should aim to clear this as quickly as possible. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Deal with the other mechanics the same as you would on P1 and dps until phase hp. Ideally you phase before the virus even comes out, but this is heavily influenced by your P1 rotation. It's important not to end the phase with Tendrils as the previous spec unless you are confident dealing with hold still as the first spec on P3. \u2b25 Rotations (250%-999%) \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e Coming soon \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e[Old Rotations: https://i.imgur.com/tmZu6W6.png ] Phase 3 \u2b25 Mechanics Same situation where the first spec depends on last spec from P2; however, there will always be seven auto attacks first. Refer to diagram. Assuming phase after virus and before uppercut. 7 Autos \u2192 Uppercut \u2192 3 Autos \u2192 Hold Still \u2192 3 Autos \u2192 Virus (if 50%+ enrage; skips this spec if <50%) \u2192 3 Autos \u2192 Repeat from Uppercut until phase hp \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 On P3, a red beam will spawn at a random location, lasting for 33 ticks. While players are standing in the beam, they will take and deal 30% increased damage. While Telos is in the beam, he will deal 30% increased damage. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Telos\u2019s special bar is replaced by a balancing bar. When the bar is in the red on the left, Telos will siphon player\u2019s prayer and adrenaline. When the bar is in the red on the right, Telos will send out a shockwave dealing typeless damage. Telos\u2019 bar charges to the right when he is standing in the beam or golems are alive. Telos' bar naturally moves to the left otherwise. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 When the balance is in the red on the right, Telos will emit one shockwave along with Uppercut and Hold Still. Depending on how far the bar is to the right, Telos will emit up to three shockwaves with the virus. The shockwave can easily nuke players at higher enrages. Reflect, debilitate, or even barricade can be used to survive being nuked. On the other end, at 3500%+ enrage, player\u2019s will be smited if Telos is not allowed to step into the beam for a tick. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 When starting out, players can escape into the corner to ensure Telos does not have a beam spawn on him. Once comfortable, it is better to not move from drop down to get into the beam as fast as possible. Once the beam spawns, bladed dive into it to decrease the likelihood Telos walk over you into the beam. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 The worst case scenario is ending P2 on tendrils because the first spec on P3 will be hold still, so onslaught cannot be fully used to dump dps and the phase can take longer than needed. If this happens, it is often better to just dump thresholds in the beam dealing with mechanics as they come and killing golems if needed. You can also use Limitless if necessary. \u2b25 Rotations (250%-999%) \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 (3t) \u2192 / (depending on adren and hp remaining) \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e[Old Rotations: https://i.imgur.com/fKsuypa.png ] Phase 4 \u2b25 Mechanics Again, first spec depends on last spec from P3. Refer to diagram. Assuming last spec on P3 was Uppercut. 3 Autos \u2192 Uppercut \u2192 3 Autos \u2192 Weak Anima Bomb \u2192 3 Autos \u2192 Hold Still \u2192 Repeat until Telos reaches 0 hp \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 The one new special is the weak anima bomb which can be dealt with using debilitate on Telos or resonance if phasing into a font before hold still. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 No beams spawn on P4; however, there are three fonts which must be filled and used to negate the instakill attack. The pure font (next to where you drop down) becomes active when Telos is at \u00be hp, volcanic at \u00bd hp, and corrupt at \u00bc hp, moving clockwise around the arena. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Telos\u2019s number of auto attacks between specs carries over from font to font, so if Telos was one auto attack from firing off a weak anima bomb before the font became active, there will only be one attack before the weak anima bomb after the instakill. There is a slight caveat with phasing on hold still that will be discussed later. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 When these fonts become active, Telos is immune to damage and one of each type of golem spawns. Pure golems (green) deal increased damage the longer they are alive. Volcanic golems (red) will occasionally stun and bind players for five ticks. Corrupt golems (black) reduce player\u2019s defensive rating by 1% for each stack up to 100 stacks. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Players must stand in each font to charge it. Players will take five hits of typeless damage which can be reduced with reflect except for the last hit which can only be negated with barricade. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 After using the font to negate the instakill, player\u2019s defensives will be reset and put on a 10 tick cooldown. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 The priority is to always kill the red golem as quickly as possible to avoid stuns. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Barring taking an eternity to get into the first and third fonts, most players will receive a So Much Power in place of the next spec after the second font. \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 The best way to deal with SMP is to just resonance or disruption shield the hit as this completely negates the hit while preserving adrenaline. SMP behaves much like Hold Still in the sense that an auto attack comes before the actual big damage. Be sure to resonance the SMP not the auto attack. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 When trying to resonance SMP with golems still alive, Surge away so their hits don't snipe Resonance, or Devotion , Deflect Melee and Resonance the SMP. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 At lower enrages a spirit shield can be used to reduce the hit from SMP to a survivable number. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 If phasing into the font with one or zero autos before the next spec, Telos will have to be stun-locked to allow for defensives to come off cooldown to deal with SMP. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Continue to dps and deal with mechanics until Telos\u2019s hp hits 0.

Whittle down the golems with AoEs before clearing the virus and killing them at the font. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 The virus will be a random color. Surge /bladed dive to the beam to cleanse the virus and back to sunshine/green beam as fast as possible. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 If not fonting wait for the next rock to fall, onslaught until either telos dies or the next rock falls. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 <1000% immortality to negate the Insta-Kill Bomb \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 1000%+ activate the font and get back onto Telos. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Continue to dps Telos until he dies. Finally, congratulations on loot. \u2b25 Tips and Tricks \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 To properly tag P5 on the first tick, watch the pure font on the left side, when it does this animation https://i.imgur.com/H3CceEu.gif , press target cycle. If using you must throw it one tick after target cycling. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Telos auto-attacks can hit surprisingly hard, so make sure you use Deflect Magic at the start of the phase. Use Deflect Melee whenever Telos is stunlocked, while minions are alive. Ideally, you should prayer flick between Melee and Magic. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Always have a dreadnip deployed. They have a chance of stunning Telos and consequently triggering his freedom timer - especially helpful during P5 start and your onslaught. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Telos' freedom is triggered on a set timer, starting from the beginning of P5, as long as you stun or bind him at any point between his freedoms. This means that with a 20-second freedom (on 250-999%), and Asphyxiate having a cooldown of 20 seconds, your Asphyxiate + Deep Impact combo will always stunlock Telos if used properly. Take advantage of this! \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 In the event that you get an instant kill, use and and . Rotate defensives such as / / / while finishing telos. Using is recommended. Use and if volcanics. The general idea behind this is to maximize damage output on Telos while having defensives up to tank minions. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Minion luring is important - for side beams, simply standing 1 out of MD will generally lure the golems properly. For back beams, you want to stand 1 out of MD, then move 2 squares back to lure the golems. Here is an image detailing the lure: \u2b25 Enrage Checkpoints \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 100-149% : and under Sunshine will kill all of the minions. Telos cannot use Freedom at this enrage - with stuns and a Sunshine rotation, you should be able to kill him before virus. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 150-249% : under Sunshine will kill all of the minions. Telos will start using Freedom every 30 seconds, however there is no immunity period after using it. You can either tank the virus with Revenge/Reprisal or clear it. This is easily 0 fontable. \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 250-349% : under Sunshine will generally kill all of the minions, but you may need to start using and to clear out remainders. Telos will start using Freedom every 20 seconds, with a 6 second immunity period, and will remain that way all the way to 999%. You should start to learn to clear the virus efficiently - use Debilitate on the virus for safety. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 350-999% : under Sunshine will kill all or most of the minions. Using a Kalphite Rebounder and Revenge may be useful for dealing with the minions, especially if you have Ruthless on your defender. At this point, you can Debilitate the virus if it comes out, or Barricade if low on food, though neither is strictly necessary. DPS and stunning becomes increasingly important in order to get a 0 font. \u2b25 Rotations (250%-999%) Note: Autos are intentionally omitted for the sake of stunlocking \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Start \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u2192 Run to Left Beam \u2192 \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Left Beam \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u2192 ( if volcanic) \u2192 \u200e \u200e (3 hit) \u2192 > \u200e \u200e \u2192 > \u2192 minions > > ( if volcanic) > > \u2192 Telos \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 clear virus after beam change \u2192 / in green beam \u2192 after rockfall \u2192 stuns/threshes/gstaff to finish \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Right Beam \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e after Corrupt (Off GCD) \u2192 \u2192 ( if volcanic) \u2192 \u200e \u200e \u2192 \u2192 \u200e \u200e \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 same strategy as left beam \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Back Beam \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200eWait a tick after GCD \u2192 \u200e \u200e \u2192 \u2192 ( if volcanic) \u2192 \u200e \u200e \u2192 \u2192 > same strategy as left beam Using Luck of the Dwarves at Telos Telos' chest interacts very curiously to Luck of the Dwarves. You can do a 0-999 streak and then put on your Luck of the Dwarves before you claim, what happens next is that every roll that you previously did during the streak will be refactored with LotD's 1% increase alongside slightly increasing the number of common drops that you can get but most importantly you can reroll a common drop to an unique if you're lucky enough. The most accepted estimate chance for this to happen is around 1/1000.

Telos is regarded as the most profitable boss currently once a player is able to consistently kill and streak high enrages. Telos drops t92 two-hand weapons consisting of the Staff of Sliske, Zaros Godsword, and Seren Godbow. Telos has a unique looting mechanic where players can choose to risk the drops from a kill for increased chance of better loot at the cost of a more difficult fight known as streaking. Each kill players choose to forgo claiming the loot increases enrage between 5-20%. As enrage increases, mechanics are added to the fight as well as every mistake being much more punishing. A successful kill at 500% enrage unlocks the green Warden title, a successful kill at 2000% enrage unlocks the silver Warden title, and enrage is capped at 4000% where a successful kill will unlock the golden Warden title. On phases 1 and 2, Telos will attack with melee unless players are out of range. When out of range, Telos will shoot off a magic attack and move into melee distance again.

Telos' bar naturally moves to the left otherwise. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 When the balance is in the red on the right, Telos will emit one shockwave along with Uppercut and Hold Still. Depending on how far the bar is to the right, Telos will emit up to three shockwaves with the virus. The shockwave can easily nuke players at higher enrages. Reflect, debilitate, or even barricade can be used to survive being nuked. On the other end, at 3500%+ enrage, player\u2019s will be smited if Telos is not allowed to step into the beam for a tick. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 When starting out, players can escape into the corner to ensure Telos does not have a beam spawn on him. Once comfortable, it is better to not move from drop down to get into the beam as fast as possible. Once the beam spawns, bladed dive into it to decrease the likelihood Telos walk over you into the beam. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 The worst case scenario is ending P2 on tendrils because the first spec on P3 will be hold still, so onslaught cannot be fully used to dump dps and the phase can take longer than needed. If this happens, it is often better to just dump thresholds in the beam dealing with mechanics as they come and killing golems if needed. You can also use Limitless if necessary. \u2b25 Rotations (250%-999%) \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 (3t) \u2192 / (depending on adren and hp remaining) \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e[Old Rotations: https://i.imgur.com/fKsuypa.png ]","title":"Phase 3"},{"location":"pvme-guides/high-tier-pvm/telos-0-999/#phase-4","text":"\u2b25 Mechanics Again, first spec depends on last spec from P3.

The pure font (next to where you drop down) becomes active when Telos is at \u00be hp, volcanic at \u00bd hp, and corrupt at \u00bc hp, moving clockwise around the arena. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Telos\u2019s number of auto attacks between specs carries over from font to font, so if Telos was one auto attack from firing off a weak anima bomb before the font became active, there will only be one attack before the weak anima bomb after the instakill. There is a slight caveat with phasing on hold still that will be discussed later. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 When these fonts become active, Telos is immune to damage and one of each type of golem spawns. Pure golems (green) deal increased damage the longer they are alive. Volcanic golems (red) will occasionally stun and bind players for five ticks. Corrupt golems (black) reduce player\u2019s defensive rating by 1% for each stack up to 100 stacks. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Players must stand in each font to charge it.

SMP behaves much like Hold Still in the sense that an auto attack comes before the actual big damage. Be sure to resonance the SMP not the auto attack. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 When trying to resonance SMP with golems still alive, Surge away so their hits don't snipe Resonance, or Devotion , Deflect Melee and Resonance the SMP. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 At lower enrages a spirit shield can be used to reduce the hit from SMP to a survivable number. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 If phasing into the font with one or zero autos before the next spec, Telos will have to be stun-locked to allow for defensives to come off cooldown to deal with SMP. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Continue to dps and deal with mechanics until Telos\u2019s hp hits 0. If <100% enrage, congratulations on loot. \u2b25 Rotations (250%-999%) Goal with P4 is to minimise the number of specs (and hence autos aswell) This is done by using ice barrage as each font ends in order to break Telos' freedom and allow effective stunlocking immediately - meaning ideally no autos between each font.

If using you must throw it one tick after target cycling. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Telos auto-attacks can hit surprisingly hard, so make sure you use Deflect Magic at the start of the phase. Use Deflect Melee whenever Telos is stunlocked, while minions are alive. Ideally, you should prayer flick between Melee and Magic. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Always have a dreadnip deployed. They have a chance of stunning Telos and consequently triggering his freedom timer - especially helpful during P5 start and your onslaught. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Telos' freedom is triggered on a set timer, starting from the beginning of P5, as long as you stun or bind him at any point between his freedoms. This means that with a 20-second freedom (on 250-999%), and Asphyxiate having a cooldown of 20 seconds, your Asphyxiate + Deep Impact combo will always stunlock Telos if used properly. Take advantage of this! \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 In the event that you get an instant kill, use and and . Rotate defensives such as / / / while finishing telos. Using is recommended.

For back beams, you want to stand 1 out of MD, then move 2 squares back to lure the golems. Here is an image detailing the lure: \u2b25 Enrage Checkpoints \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 100-149% : and under Sunshine will kill all of the minions.

Telos will start using Freedom every 30 seconds, however there is no immunity period after using it. You can either tank the virus with Revenge/Reprisal or clear it. This is easily 0 fontable. \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 250-349% : under Sunshine will generally kill all of the minions, but you may need to start using and to clear out remainders. Telos will start using Freedom every 20 seconds, with a 6 second immunity period, and will remain that way all the way to 999%. You should start to learn to clear the virus efficiently - use Debilitate on the virus for safety. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 350-999% : under Sunshine will kill all or most of the minions. Using a Kalphite Rebounder and Revenge may be useful for dealing with the minions, especially if you have Ruthless on your defender. At this point, you can Debilitate the virus if it comes out, or Barricade if low on food, though neither is strictly necessary.

This means your adrenaline potion won't be on cooldown for Phase 4 start. It's important to make sure you are either south or west of Telos to ensure your deto wm hits are all on the same tick.

The big objectives are to block and reduce as much damage without needing much defensives and to apply a Barge bleed + Hurricane on tendrils perfectly. Target cycle + + \u2192 [ if you get a Relentless proc] \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 [Skip if you did not get a Relentless proc] \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 stall + release right before next ability \u2192 \u2192 That stalled Assault is important so you line up two Assault hits and Hurricane all on top of each other for tendrils, nearly guaranteeing an instant free or a tick-late free even past 2700% enrage. During the Cleave and Decimate after the initial Berserk , you should be running out of range to bait out Telos\u2019s Magic attacks. This is super important because Telos\u2019s Magic attacks hit far less than his Melee attacks, which makes it much easier to survive when under Berserk , especially as you approach 4000%. After the Cleave after Hurricane , it depends entirely on how much LP Telos has. If he hits 450k right after Cleave , wait until the tick Telos phases, then use Quake + Bladed Dive to the drop-off point. That Quake is important because it lets you carry over that damage to the next phase immediately, giving you a noticeable headstart for P2. This works because AoE abilities like Quake , Bombardment , and Chain calculate their damage late enough to be forced into the next phase if you use them on the same tick as phasing to the next phase. Practically speaking, only Quake can be used like this as Cleave hits too quickly. If Telos is not immediately phased after that Cleave , do strong basics like Decimate and Sever to get it down before uppercut happens, then Quake prephase if it lines up nicely. If you do get uppercut, phase him immediately after and prephase with a Quake . Phase 2 The start of P2 depends on how many autoattacks Telos has before Onslaught and how much adrenaline you have going into P2. If you have over 74% adrenaline, you will want to ZGS spec before bleeding Greater Flurry , listed as [1]. Otherwise, go with the abilities listed as [2]. If 2 autos before Onslaught: Wait a tick \u2192 \u2192 [1] OR [2] \u2192 [1] OR [2] \u2192 [1] OR [2] + on the same tick \u2192 + back into ZGS spec \u2192 + throw right as Telos autos \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 basics \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 basics until 300k \u2192 prephase Waiting that one tick before Barge is extremely important, because if you just Barge instantly you will deal no damage. So wait a tick for that damage immunity to pass by. The Escape and Bladed Dive back in are done to ensure Telos leaves the black beam with zero RNG. It must be perfectly done though, as any other deviation like being late will most likely cause the lure to fail. If 0-1 autos before Onslaught: Wait a tick \u2192 \u2192 [1] OR [2] \u2192 [1] OR [2] \u2192 [1] OR [2] \u2192 + drag Telos out of the beam \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 basics \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 basics until 300k \u2192 prephase Try to get Assault in as early as possible, and try to aim to phase before Hold Still as well if you can. If after uppercut on P1: Wait a tick \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 switch to 2h and auto + \u2192 + \u2192 \u2192 + walk \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 basics and thresholds until 300k \u2192 prephase Ideally, you should not get this, but in the event you do, that\u2019s what you should do. The autoattack with 2h after Destroy is known as \u201c5TAA\u201d, or \u201c5T\u201d for short. Basically, after a dual wield ability, you can switch to your 2h weapon and force out a quick autoattack two ticks after that ability. Because of the stun duration, this 5T wastes just enough time yet still gains damage to allow for the longest stun duration from a bled Destroy to Backhand to Forceful Backhand . This will get used in both P3 and P4, so even if you don\u2019t get uppercut on P1 to force this rotation, it\u2019s worth learning this. Phase 3 Wait a tick \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 switch to 2h and auto + \u2192 + into the beam \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 basics to 150k You don\u2019t necessarily need to Quake prephase here because P4 is somewhat time-locked anyway, but it's somewhat helpful to. If you don\u2019t have enough adrenaline to fit in both Blood Tendrils and Slaughter before Assault, just skip Blood Tendrils and do some basics instead. In order to make P4 better at higher enrages so you aren\u2019t scrambling for adrenaline, you can lure Telos into the beam and balance the bar. That way, when Telos drains adrenaline right after Assault , it\u2019s not large at all. Should the beam spawn on Telos, do this conservatively, else you will have to delay your Assault by one ability so you can use Disruption Shield on the explosion losslessly. Phase 4 The goal here is to do as much damage as possible to Telos before he can fire off any special attacks, so rocks are completely skipped. Wait a tick \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 switch to 2h and auto + \u2192 \u2192 Use limitless here if you can. If your adrenaline is really dire, skip Statius\u2019s warhammer and Quake instead. For font 1, Resonance + Reflect and build to 100% adrenaline. Wait for the chatbox message \u201cTelos: You dare to defy me?\u201d and throw a sticky bomb on the golems right when that happens. Get out of range from the golems, then Barge Telos right as he gets up. Safe rotation (0 Telos autos): Telos + run back to font \u2192 \u2192 wait 2 ticks, 5T auto if you can + \u2192 \u2192 or if you missed it Fast rotation (1 Telos auto): Telos + run back to font \u2192 \u2192 3 hit \u2192 or or if you missed it For font 2, do the same thing except you\u2019re tanking everything here, so be prepared to eat up a lot here. This time though, use Revenge with defender . Skip Revenge if you are not using a defender . Use the same cues as in font 1 and go to town. You can use Devotion here to mitigate damage, but if you\u2019re going for fast font 3, skip that. After second instant kill, Telos right as the instant kill lands. This pops Telos\u2019s Freedom immediately, delaying his next action. Bleed \u2192 3 hit \u2192 for safety, otherwise just use a basic for more adrenaline if you are confident in your DPS. Safe font 3: After Telos phases into font 3, turn the corner around the middle beam area and wait for all the golems to line up single-file. Bladed Dive over to the end of the group of three golems and use Ingenuity of the Humans + Entangle on the closest golem. This traps all golems behind that one golem for 24 seconds, which is more than enough to deal with Telos himself. Resonance and Reflect the font, then ZGS spec + adrenaline potion . Barge him with Mobile , then stall a Cleave . Release the Cleave two ticks after the message \u201cTelos is preparing to fire an anima bomb!\u201d and bleed Assault right after. Follow that up with either Destroy (since it can stun out of range), or Backhand \u2192 Cleave or Destroy and finish the job there. Alternatively, just bleed Destroy right after instant kill, 5T to Backhand then Forceful Backhand . Fast font 3 (dangerous, experimental for now): Immediately head into font 3 and start eating up while using Resonance + Reflect . Right at the end of the font, use Devotion and lure the golems away from Telos. Sticky bomb them and Barge Telos \u2192 Assault \u2192 Destroy \u2192 basics until dead. Extremely dangerous however, and not recommended. Phase 5 Make sure you have Disruption Shield active and are praying Melee at the start of the phase. If you do the rest of this phase perfectly, Telos and golems cannot KO you at the start of the phase no matter what, as Disruption Shield will always prioritize blocking Telos's Magic attack.

The only risk is a potential rock before Barricade , but that\u2019s very rare. You can also afford to swap Statius\u2019s warhammer with Freedom on side beam for that bit of extra safety if volcanics took their time to start hitting you at the start. And as before, if you are not confident with volcanics out there, you can simply use Immortality instead. It\u2019s also a near necessity to wait those two ticks before Barge as well and nail the timing. If you Barge too early, golems can surround you when inside the beam and it can hurt far more, and if you Barge too late your Disruption Shield can no longer guarantee you not getting KOed at the start.","title":"Telos 1k plus melee"},{"location":"pvme-guides/high-tier-pvm/telos-1k-plus-melee/#telos-1k-plus-melee","text":"Telos with Melee (1000% to 4000%)","title":"Telos 1k plus melee"},{"location":"pvme-guides/high-tier-pvm/telos-1k-plus-melee/#introduction","text":"Using Melee against Telos is generally more dangerous and risky than Magic.

During the Cleave and Decimate after the initial Berserk , you should be running out of range to bait out Telos\u2019s Magic attacks. This is super important because Telos\u2019s Magic attacks hit far less than his Melee attacks, which makes it much easier to survive when under Berserk , especially as you approach 4000%. After the Cleave after Hurricane , it depends entirely on how much LP Telos has. If he hits 450k right after Cleave , wait until the tick Telos phases, then use Quake + Bladed Dive to the drop-off point. That Quake is important because it lets you carry over that damage to the next phase immediately, giving you a noticeable headstart for P2. This works because AoE abilities like Quake , Bombardment , and Chain calculate their damage late enough to be forced into the next phase if you use them on the same tick as phasing to the next phase. Practically speaking, only Quake can be used like this as Cleave hits too quickly. If Telos is not immediately phased after that Cleave , do strong basics like Decimate and Sever to get it down before uppercut happens, then Quake prephase if it lines up nicely. If you do get uppercut, phase him immediately after and prephase with a Quake .","title":"Phase 1"},{"location":"pvme-guides/high-tier-pvm/telos-1k-plus-melee/#phase-2","text":"The start of P2 depends on how many autoattacks Telos has before Onslaught and how much adrenaline you have going into P2.

So wait a tick for that damage immunity to pass by. The Escape and Bladed Dive back in are done to ensure Telos leaves the black beam with zero RNG. It must be perfectly done though, as any other deviation like being late will most likely cause the lure to fail.

The autoattack with 2h after Destroy is known as \u201c5TAA\u201d, or \u201c5T\u201d for short. Basically, after a dual wield ability, you can switch to your 2h weapon and force out a quick autoattack two ticks after that ability. Because of the stun duration, this 5T wastes just enough time yet still gains damage to allow for the longest stun duration from a bled Destroy to Backhand to Forceful Backhand . This will get used in both P3 and P4, so even if you don\u2019t get uppercut on P1 to force this rotation, it\u2019s worth learning this.","title":"Phase 2"},{"location":"pvme-guides/high-tier-pvm/telos-1k-plus-melee/#phase-3","text":"Wait a tick \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 switch to 2h and auto + \u2192 + into the beam \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 basics to 150k You don\u2019t necessarily need to Quake prephase here because P4 is somewhat time-locked anyway, but it's somewhat helpful to.

That way, when Telos drains adrenaline right after Assault , it\u2019s not large at all.

It's very important to use Needle Strike right before your specs . If you just used 2h abilities instead, you would not be able to spec twice in a row at all due to the way specs track autoattack cooldown. If you have enough adrenaline, you can prephase damage with Bombardment . That is important because AoE abilities like Bombardment , Quake , and Chain calculate their damage late enough to be forced into the next phase if you use them on the same tick as phasing to the next phase. Practically speaking, both Bombardment and Ricochet can be used like this for such prephasing. Phase 2 The start of P2 depends on how many autoattacks Telos has before Onslaught and how much adrenaline you have going into P2. In this rotation, you absolutely want to at least get Rapid Fire off and skip Snapshot if you don't have enough adrenaline. Both P2 and P3 can start to switch bolts depending on procs. You generally want to camp ruby bolts , then once you get a proc you swap to hydrix bolts for 2-3 abilities, then swap back to ruby bolts , although it's easiest to do so in the middle of Rapid Fire. Right before you go into the next phase though, at around 10k-20k before phasing, you'd want to camp hydrix so you can chance for that extra bit of adrenaline. You also want to never use ruby bolts with SGB spec on P2 and P3, since they can do too much \"true\" damage and cause Telos to phase too quickly by going into the next phase while still being far above the normal phase-end LP, causing extremely undesirable situations in the worst of cases. If 3 autos before Onslaught: + \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 + run to southwest corner \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 basics until 300k If 2 autos before Onslaught: + \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 + run to southwest corner \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 basics until 300k If 1 auto before Onslaught: + \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 + run to southwest corner \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 basics until 300k If 0 autos before Onslaught: + \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 + run to southwest corner \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 basics until 300k For all of these rotations, you can afford to cancel Rapid Fire a tick early to fit Snapshot inside ECB easily without taking heavy damage. In addition, it's extremely recommended to use the powerburst of vitality right after Onslaught to tank hits more easily. You can afford to prephase with a Bombardment here to make P3 a bit better, but it's not super needed. Phase 3 Fast rotation: + \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 + walk under \u2192 + to beam \u2192 (cancel one tick earlier) \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 basics until 150k Safer rotation: + \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 + walk under \u2192 + to beam \u2192 wait a tick + \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 basics until 150k Nothing too fancy here. Prephasing at the end with a Bombardment is extremely difficult at high enrage thanks to adrenaline drains. Phase 4 The goal here is to do as much damage as possible to Telos before he can fire off any special attacks, so rocks are completely skipped. Permanently switch to hydrix bolts for the entire phase, as ruby bolts start to become far less effective. If above ~40% adrenaline: + \u2192 \u2192 right before next autoattack \u2192 \u2192 OR If only around 25% adrenaline: + \u2192 \u2192 + walk \u2192 \u2192 OR If only around 9% adrenaline: \u2192 \u2192 right before next autoattack \u2192 \u2192 OR For font 1, Resonance + Reflect and build to 100% adrenaline. Wait for the chatbox message \u201cTelos: You dare to defy me?\u201d and make your way to run under Telos with golems. Equip your chinchompas and SGB spec right as the message for Telos firing the anima bomb appears. The earlier the better, although the most ideal time for fitting in the most damage as possible is a tick after that message appears. Your chin SGB should immediately delete his LP and phase him into the next font, although if it doesn't work out, use Demoralise and Rout and phase him before he can use any autoattacks at all. For font 2, this is where things get rough. Drop target on Telos by targeting him before he gets to the font, then once he kneels on the ground you will lose target. Get inside the font and spam your solid food and prayer restore. You cannot use either Devotion or Reflect as you will need it for font 3. Use Resonance to help tank some of the damage. Once the font is at least 4/5 of the way dead, target a nearby golem and use Corruption Shot with bolas . It's also very important to use ingenuity of the humans with that Corruption Shot . This will spread the bind to the entire group of golems, which will let you run away from them to DPS Telos. Around 2.4 seconds after Corruption Shot , use Demoralise on Telos to pop his Freedom. Look out for his message \"You dare to defy me?\" Four ticks after that message appears, use Snipe \u2192 Snapshot \u2192 Rout \u2192 dark bow spec to phase him into the next font immediately. Use an adrenaline renewal immediately after to generate more adrenaline more quickly. If you are a bit late on Demoralise to not allow Snipe , there's a backup rotation. Stall Snapshot on Telos, then release it a bit after the instant-kill message, then use Greater Dazing Shot immediately after releasing. Then use Rout to dark bow spec and use an adrenaline renewal . For font 3, Resonance \u2192 Reflect again, and use Anticipation with Clear Headed 4 . Right as the font dies, use Devotion and make your way to under Telos again. Using Surge immediately as you get hit by the final font hit can help immensely to getting into position quickly. Use Corruption Shot with bolas on a golem and wait to chin SGB again. Fire it off and finish off Telos right then and there. Phase 5 Make sure you have Disruption Shield active. At high enrage, you can get comboed out somewhat easily, so try to play it a bit safe until you get inside the green beam. The bulk of your DPS isn't going to come until then anyway. Target cycle + + \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 OR \u2192 \u2192 spam If Telos isn't dead when Barricade is about to run out, just Surge to the virus beam and kite the minions as you do more damage. Build to dark bow specs and finish off Telos. Use ruby bolts up until 80k LP, then switch to hydrix bolts for the rest of the phase. If you get volcanics, you'll need to use Anticipation with Clear Headed 4 in place of Revenge , and replace Snapshot with Revenge . Use Freedom right when Anticipation wears off, then finish off Telos.","title":"Telos 1k plus ranged"},{"location":"pvme-guides/high-tier-pvm/telos-1k-plus-ranged/#telos-1k-plus-ranged","text":"Telos with Ranged (1000% to 4000%)","title":"Telos 1k plus ranged"},{"location":"pvme-guides/high-tier-pvm/telos-1k-plus-ranged/#introduction","text":"Ranged Telos is by a long shot the most difficult, yet quickest way to get kills.

If you have enough adrenaline, you can prephase damage with Bombardment . That is important because AoE abilities like Bombardment , Quake , and Chain calculate their damage late enough to be forced into the next phase if you use them on the same tick as phasing to the next phase. Practically speaking, both Bombardment and Ricochet can be used like this for such prephasing.","title":"Phase 1"},{"location":"pvme-guides/high-tier-pvm/telos-1k-plus-ranged/#phase-2","text":"The start of P2 depends on how many autoattacks Telos has before Onslaught and how much adrenaline you have going into P2. In this rotation, you absolutely want to at least get Rapid Fire off and skip Snapshot if you don't have enough adrenaline. Both P2 and P3 can start to switch bolts depending on procs. You generally want to camp ruby bolts , then once you get a proc you swap to hydrix bolts for 2-3 abilities, then swap back to ruby bolts , although it's easiest to do so in the middle of Rapid Fire. Right before you go into the next phase though, at around 10k-20k before phasing, you'd want to camp hydrix so you can chance for that extra bit of adrenaline. You also want to never use ruby bolts with SGB spec on P2 and P3, since they can do too much \"true\" damage and cause Telos to phase too quickly by going into the next phase while still being far above the normal phase-end LP, causing extremely undesirable situations in the worst of cases.

In addition, it's extremely recommended to use the powerburst of vitality right after Onslaught to tank hits more easily. You can afford to prephase with a Bombardment here to make P3 a bit better, but it's not super needed.","title":"Phase 2"},{"location":"pvme-guides/high-tier-pvm/telos-1k-plus-ranged/#phase-3","text":"Fast rotation: + \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 + walk under \u2192 + to beam \u2192 (cancel one tick earlier) \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 basics until 150k Safer rotation: + \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 + walk under \u2192 + to beam \u2192 wait a tick + \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 basics until 150k Nothing too fancy here.

Wait for the chatbox message \u201cTelos: You dare to defy me?\u201d and make your way to run under Telos with golems. Equip your chinchompas and SGB spec right as the message for Telos firing the anima bomb appears. The earlier the better, although the most ideal time for fitting in the most damage as possible is a tick after that message appears. Your chin SGB should immediately delete his LP and phase him into the next font, although if it doesn't work out, use Demoralise and Rout and phase him before he can use any autoattacks at all. For font 2, this is where things get rough. Drop target on Telos by targeting him before he gets to the font, then once he kneels on the ground you will lose target. Get inside the font and spam your solid food and prayer restore. You cannot use either Devotion or Reflect as you will need it for font 3. Use Resonance to help tank some of the damage. Once the font is at least 4/5 of the way dead, target a nearby golem and use Corruption Shot with bolas . It's also very important to use ingenuity of the humans with that Corruption Shot . This will spread the bind to the entire group of golems, which will let you run away from them to DPS Telos. Around 2.4 seconds after Corruption Shot , use Demoralise on Telos to pop his Freedom. Look out for his message \"You dare to defy me?\" Four ticks after that message appears, use Snipe \u2192 Snapshot \u2192 Rout \u2192 dark bow spec to phase him into the next font immediately. Use an adrenaline renewal immediately after to generate more adrenaline more quickly. If you are a bit late on Demoralise to not allow Snipe , there's a backup rotation. Stall Snapshot on Telos, then release it a bit after the instant-kill message, then use Greater Dazing Shot immediately after releasing. Then use Rout to dark bow spec and use an adrenaline renewal . For font 3, Resonance \u2192 Reflect again, and use Anticipation with Clear Headed 4 . Right as the font dies, use Devotion and make your way to under Telos again. Using Surge immediately as you get hit by the final font hit can help immensely to getting into position quickly. Use Corruption Shot with bolas on a golem and wait to chin SGB again.

For simplicity each person will correspond with either \"Role A\" or \"Role B\". This guide also implies that whoever attempts this knows the appropriate gear and spells needed. Phase Two and Nine can be done through basic Duo Normal mode knowledge. Each Hammer uses Ingenuity Sigil unless on the rare occasion it's on cooldown phase 10 and therefore you'll need to use malevolence prayer and/or take off armor. Each Devotion is used along with intercept. Combust is a great ability when walked. Can be done by surging underneath Vorago once used and then Bladed Diving back. Deathtouch Bracelet may cause PKs during links because of its reflecting ability. Also Spellcasters cause the ability they proc on to hit instantly; if you're trying to Blitz-Sonic during reflect to be tick perfect, they will pk. T90 gloves are the safest option. Should have Blood Barrage set as your primary spell but having Blitz on bar as well can be useful in situations like after reflect.

Stand on the TL spot to give the red to Role B. This allows you to disrupt earlier and save 5% adrenaline. \u200e \u200eStand directly south and bring Vorago south as he spawns. The timing for target cycle is when the timer hits 9.6 seconds (9 seconds if you weren't in TL spot.) Auto - Gstaff - Combust - Wild Magic. As he is about to melee you, start running east and use Corruption Blast. Run all the way into the southeast corner and asphyxiate. If done correctly, you will get a full asphyxiate off before the 2nd attack. Devotion if needed. Ingenuity hammer and bladed dive to the north to avoid the blue bomb that came with the red. At this time you can soul split and check the timer. At around :32 seconds, allow vorago to attack you once and surge west and get in the south voke spot. Turn on soulsplit and resonance + voke and as soon as Role B jumps, surge south and touch the wall. When Vorago turns around like at the end of the clip, start running back in and use meta as soon as you see Role B jump off. Voke Vorago and stand closer in than Role B. As soon as the red comes out, tank 4 blues and when the next red comes out you will be intercepted. If the phase is any longer than this, Role B will continue intercepting you. https://clips.twitch.tv/SeductiveWealthyPizzaCclamChamp Role B Be as close to tick perfect during top lure and Wild magic voke as soon as possible. If not 7 affinity stacks, ideally should Guthix Staff as well. Jump as soon as possible and spam surge. \u200e \u200eStand further out than Role A and take the first red bomb. Bladed dive under Vorago and soulsplit your hp up. When the next red bomb comes out, intercept and devotion. If the phase is any longer than this, continue intercepting Role A and use resonance when needed. Phase Two (Bring Him Down) Player B will place a dummy as the last orb is clicked; make sure it is by both players. Sun Immediately and continue building while clicking Vorago. Once it is attack-able, start with a Wild Magic and Aphyxiate, shattering during BHD if using a Pack Mammoth. Once the phase is over it is very helpful to use Natural instinct on the dummy as Vorago lands his second jump (there are three jumps in total). Phase 3 (Ceiling Collapse) Role A Pre Sunshine Dropdown near the center and build with a defensive and adrenaline potion. Pre Reflect rotation should consist of a wildmagic and guthix staff. During reflect devotion Role B and Detonate. Post Reflect aphyxiate and continue Dpsing. Run out far enough to receive the Redbomb and go under Vorago after your sunshine runs out. SGB spec after sunshine. Ideally should phase Pre Reflect but if not run underneath vorago on the second reflect and intercept Role B using reflect. Phase soon after. Role B Very similar to Role A. \u200e \u200eSunshine dropdown near the center. Auto Dbreath (Voke) Wild Magic Combust Hammer. Detonate during reflect. Release Detonate with an Auto and Dbreath, start running under vorago Corruption Blast and Combust and Bladed dive back to sunshine. Run in to give the Redbomb to Role A and then use devotion. Dps until Phased and if not pre reflect provoke the boss for Role A. Notes: Using Resonance on the third blue is ideal. Can resonance again post Red or re-Disrupt. Phase 4 (Scopulus) Role A : Stand northwest on drop. Vuln Wildmagic and run towards Role B. Asphyxiate until you are barricaded and then charge Detonate when scopulus are stacked. Tsunami when 100% adrenaline and Bladed dive back towards the north wall and continue running along the walls in a circle. Limitless Devotion Player B as soon as possible and continue 4-Tick Baraging and using thresholds. Build to Cade when Player B uses devotion and barricade after and start building back to 100 for Vit phase. This is a good point to stop running and provoke the Scops in order to restack them. Soon after cade runs out the phase should be over but if prolonged then can use Reflect. Role B : Go near West Scopulus spawn near the south wall. Vuln Wildmagic the West scop and run towards Role A on the west side. Barricade a little bit after first blue as this allows Role A to Dps longer without having to run away. Vuln the East Scop as soon as possible to have both south Scopulus aggro and then Provoke the north in an attempt to stack all three. Run towards role A when barricade has a few seconds left. Use as many thresholds as possible and devotion after player A does so. Can aphyxiate if there is a good distance between you and the Scopulus (Not recommended if intercepted by the other player). Reflect is phase is prolonged. Notes: Use this order of Barricade and Devotion as is most optimal for Vitalis phase cooldowns. Taunting perk is very useful on an Enhanced Excalibur or in place of Enhanced Devoted. Try staying within this cone when running the scopulus. If you are out of this area, you risk losing all 3 of the scops being stacked on a single square. The easiest way to keep them stacked is to coordinate when you break off DD with your partner and to bomb each other when devotion/caded. Phase 5 (Vitalis) Role A Have intercept ready on drop. Target cycle Hammer dropdown and use devotion, provoke and sunshine immediately while still gaining adrenaline with defensives until reflect ends. Typical Sunshine rotation while maintaining aggro or provoking if needed. Takes bleeds 1-4 and freedom 4th. During cade cast heal other on player B. Continue Dpsing until the phase is over before the second reflect. Role B Sun on dropdown, Dbreath Corruption Asphyxiate and Impact (flank) and use Devotion on reflect. Continue building on reflect with defensives and if provoke is used let Role A know to provoke. Wild magic and build to barricade. Definitely avoid solids like soups as the adren loss can result in the loss of the kill. Once bleeds start Barricade Role A and cast heal other. Voke the 5th bleed and reequip staff/duel wield. Continue Dpsing until phase is over. Notes: Do not move after the phase has ended, or you will not be able to heal your partner as you will be blocked by Vitalis If using a Pack Mammoth the Vitalis are capable of blocking you and your familiar meaning the Summoning Special will not work. To resonance (heal) a blue, you must disruption shield on the same tick, otherwise it is just reducing damage, as there are 2 blues. One missed Pray flick is practically death. In order to flank on this phase, stand in the squares marked with colored circles. The blue circle would be able to use flank, so red must have Vorago provoked. Phase 6 (Green Bomb) (Most Optimal) Role A: Sunshine Dropdown and use corrupt before reflect. If player B used devotion on the previous phase you will be the one tanking the first Greenbomb. Build to devotion and if on Player B use it. If it isn\u2019t, use either disruption shield or shield dome to tank both the Greenbomb and the blue following it. Alternatively, if player B did not use Devotion they will instead tank the first Greenbomb while player A can threshold. Resonance during reflect and detonate. Continue using thresholds and if you did not tank the first bomb you will tank the second. Run out to receive the redbomb if you did not tank the second. Optionally can reprisal this redbomb. Should not get a third greenbomb and if so use your best judgement on how to handle it. Role B: Hammer dropdown with provoke and then walk a combust. Build to sunshine if devotion is on cooldown. If it happens to be available you will tank the first greenbomb. Tank using disruption shield and/or shield dome if on yourself or devotion if on Player A. During reflect continue building using defensives. Use thresholds like wild magic but keep your adrenaline high if you are tanking the second greenbomb. If the Greenbomb is on yourself use devotion without intercepting and reprisal. Disrupt the blue following the greenbomb and keep your Lifepoints high. If the Greenbomb is on player A repeat the same thing except using intercept. Walk in as to not obtain the redbomb. Use thresholds like aphyxiate until the phase is over. Notes: Before the phase make sure your life points are above 10,000. This phase may require some improvisation so use your best judgement. Optionally you may use Barricade or Immortality however this guide covers the more optimal rotation. (Safer) Role A: Guthix staff then corrupt, build to 100% and either barricade if Greenbomb is on Player B or sunshine if on yourself. Build adren during reflect and thresh afterwards. If the second Greenbomb is on Player B then devotion and reprisal. Run in to not receive Redbomb if just tanked a Green. If there\u2019s a third Greenbomb then use immortality or reflect. Safer to just threshold if you did not sun during the first Greenbomb. Role B: Hammer Dropdown, combust, and then build to 100%. Immortality if on Role A or sunshine if not. Use Devotion to handle the second Greenbomb and reprisal if on Player A or continue threshing if on yourself. Barricade can be used to handle the third Greenbomb. Phase 7 (TeamSplit) Role A Charge Detonate and release with a hammer (if doable) on dropdown, otherwise release with auto Dbreath. Wild Magic (Hammer if not already) and sit under Vorago. Sunshine asap and Adren pot + Reprisal and disrupt the first blue, devotion the 2nd blue and dump threshes, impact flank as often as possible. Role B Charge Detonate and release with auto and guthix staff on dropdown. Build during TS and Auto WM voke out of ts, using Resonance on the third blue. Immediately use Devotion, step closer to Vorago, sunshine auto Dbreath. Build during TS and Reprisal, disrupting the first blue and using thresholds Notes: Resonance can be used on the third blue bomb and disrupt may be used during the second teamsplit to save food. If used before, the teamsplit will negate it. Phase 8 (The End) Role A: Thresh During the first quadrant and then prepare to devotion or barricade depending on what bomb type is in the second quadrant. If Blue bombs are first use devotion while Player B tags and then barricade later once the red bomb is about to hit Player B. Tag the purple bomb then instantly. This allows barricade to last a few seconds into the \u201cstand up\u201d. During reflect run underneath Vorago and intercept Player B without defensives and detonate. The next rotation you\u2019ll be tagging and depending on adrenaline, rehammer the first quadrant. Tag Blue bombs as soon as possible and red bombs as late as possible - the order doesn\u2019t matter. Sunshine roughly around the third quadrant as those bombs are being tagged. Once the second stand up starts use any thresholds you can and end the phase. Role B: Hammer and wild magic during the first quadrant and build towards sunshine. Whether blue or reds come first does not matter as long as you tag blues instantly and wait a few seconds before tagging red bombs.This allows Player A\u2019s cade to last as long as possible. Sunshine around the third quadrant and continue building until standup. Thresh until reflect and provoke the boss. Detonate after reflect ends and build adren until the second rotation. Thresh during the first quadrant and be ready to intercept player A. Devotion blue bombs and barricade redbombs. Once Stand up starts the second time, use any thresholds to finish the phase. Notes: if a third rotation is needed it can be handled like the first. Phase 9 (Waterfall) Simply do the same things as you would on P4 NM, as detailed in <#534533462430973952> or <#645460937473785886>. Focus on food preservation and sharding on CD. Make sure to summon your nihil out of your mammoth at the end of P9. Phase 10 Notes: Role A and B vary only slightly. Use disruption shield when Role B goes to reprisal the broken teamsplit. A decent starting rotation for Player A may consist of Presuning during the dropdown teamsplit, Staff Auto, Concentrated Blast, Wild Magic, Auto Sonic, Dragon breath, and then surge to Hammer. Phase 10 & 11 are very scenario based; there may be a more optimal time to hammer (perhaps after reflect on phase 10 if there is stall due to PKs). Heal other is extremely helpful when barricaded and should be used if your partner is low health. Overall Rotation: Barricading Teamsplit: Role A will use the above rotation to start off the phase while Player B will use a wildmagic and both bleed abilities. As a general rule of thumb, the person cading with always use both bleed abilities and the other player will avoid them. Always intercept early when going to barricade. This typically means - but not always - after the third ability you use out of the teamsplit. This does not however mean you will barricade early, always use barricade on the very tick either you or your partner receive the blue bomb. If your partner is in closer than you are they will receive their blue bomb quicker and therefore you need to cade on the tick of that blue. With that said, try to be max attacking distance by the release of the first blue bomb. If you are not then the cader may not have enough time to use their three abilities before barricade - this almost always results in the blue bomb hitting before cade is available There are many ways to optimise your rotation when cading. If the teamsplit is close enough, equip staff to 0-tick auto with your threshold (most likely wild magic) or If one does not have adrenaline then the first ability will be Dragonbreath instead. Use duel wield for the second and third abilities as depending on stall there might be a chance to 4-tick auto.The auto can be used into the second or third ability and might even have time for a fourth ability. Once Caded shield bash and Dragonbreath are optimal abilities however shield bash will stun if used on reflect. The person not cading will use whatever thresholds available and guthix staff. Like stated earlier, be far out at the release of the first blue bomb. Once that first blue bomb is released then you may walk in a few squares when asphyxiating as to not lose it to a pushback. During Reflect: The person who used cade should run melee distance while the other player stands 4-5 squares out. Barricader should typically use wrack, vuln and shard then proceed to using defensives - avoid using resonance if you plan to use that after you reprisal. Also avoid any other attacking abilities as there is a high chance of PK. Re-intercept the other player as soon as possible. If the last attack of reflect is a blue or if your barricade runs out early, walk out a square and shield dome. The person who didn\u2019t use cade should stand roughly 4 squares away from Vorago. This distance gives enough time for the cader to re-intercept before you take any damage. Run Melee distance when your first intercept timer is about to run out, which is generally as the second blue is coming. Being too far out at the second blue release may delay it long enough to hit as the broken teamsplit starts, causing pushback. This is solved by being the ~4 squares away. If using any offensive abilities to build adren they should be used only at the very start of reflect, then use all defensive abilities, vuln, and shard. Using the vuln-freedom trick may cause an off-hand auto to PK so be cautious. Broken Teamsplit : As the person who just barricaded, sip a saradomin brew on reflect so you can reprisal the broken teamsplit. If it\u2019s Role B that is reprisaling, both players should disrupt. It\u2019s very crucial to line up (being equidistant from the boss) during this portion of the fight. Being different distances away from Vorago means each players blue bombs will hit on different ticks. This usually causes each blue to register a pushback, pushing two squares. With that in mind, when the person who isn\u2019t reprisaling runs to their teamsplit be sure to run beside them. If their teamsplit is quite far away from vorago you only need to be max attacking distance, at that point all blues will register on the same tick.When the teamsplit explodes, Auto-Combust and trigger your reprisal. Feel free to resonance a blue and then build to sunshine. Try to use sonic and concentrated blast relatively early as they can be canceled by the incoming teamsplit. If you couldn\u2019t sun pre Cading-Teamsplit then use it after. The person who didn\u2019t cade must run to the teamsplit. Missing it will PK the other player as intercept is still active. First ability should be wild magic and then avoid using bleed abilities if the other player has used them. This is the time you should be going to hammer. There are moments where Vorago is stalled out long enough where you can hammer without receiving an attack. Right after being hit by a blue will cause pushback and delay the next attack. You can use this time to surge, hammer, and then bladed dive back to line up with the other player. Sometimes a bladed dive bug will happen and drag you to melee distance. Just run back. Use abilities like sonic and then instant hitting abilities before the cading teamsplit. Bugged Teamsplits are an unfortunate feature of the game and it is unknown what causes them. Vorago can send 2-3 blues in the timespan that he would normally send one. If this happens, only hammer if you know you have time to gain adrenaline and still barricade. The person not hammering should most likely thresh instead of sunning. Check barricade cooldowns for the next two cading teamsplits. Mauling : The person not cading should go to hammer when they know it\u2019ll be maul during reflect. Role B will shield dome and maul while Role A will drop a dummy. Phase 11 Notes: Purple and Blue bombs can hurt immensely so it is a given that Brews will be consumed. Resonance can help if Lifepoints are low and is usually a better alternative to lowering your stats. With that said, do not use Devotion. Phase 11 reflect has the same idea as Phase 10. On this phase it is optimal to Blitz-Sonic at the very end of Link in order to hit on tick and save GCD time. Overall Rotation: The Start: Build as much adrenaline on the dummy as possible using defensives and auto-attacks. Disrupt instantly and tag with vulnerability while staying in the same location you were placed in via mauling (should be one square away from melee distance). Sunshine as soon as possible unless there is a significant cooldown time, then thresh. Keep in mind you will have to hammer if Vorago wasn\u2019t at the end of P10. Whoever didn\u2019t barricade during Phase 10 maul will be cading first during this phase. Purple Bomb: Each Purple Bomb will consist of Sunshining quickly into the spec, regardless whether you\u2019ll be cading next. If Sunshine is cooldown for anything longer than ~10 seconds, use thresholds instead. Use disruption shield on the first blue into the spec unless it is also cooldown (feel free to coordinate it on the second or third blue then). Threshold in moderation if you\u2019re cading next - a lack of thresholds however, will hinder the kill. Find a balance. Guthix staff for affinity or in any case where there is an excess of adrenaline. When Vorago is being pushed back, keep stepping forward. You still want to be lined up with your partner but being 1-2 squares away from melee distance will maximise time between attacks and therefore added time to Dps. Both Purple bombs will cause pushback so if Vorago ends up in melee distance, step back. Remember to not lose non-instant hitting abilities to the impending Teamsplit (Sonic, Wildmagic, Combust, etc). Teamsplit: While being close during Purple Bomb was optimal, you still want to be far out during this teamsplit. Wait for the release of the first blue and run back to any Suns if need be. Reprisal this Teamsplit as often as possible. If manually triggered the tick before teamsplit, reprisal will hit immediately after and push before the first blue bomb. If you are the Cader, use the same idea as Phase 10 however it is imperative that the initial intercept is early (same timing as P10 intercept). If intercepted too late, the re-intercept will also be later and you\u2019ll find yourself tanking two Purple Bombs post reflect. The non-cader will use the best thresholds available and then Hammer either just before reflect or the very start. Mauling: If you found yourself needing this I don\u2019t think I need to explain it. Maul the hecking boss.","title":"Vorago duo hm"},{"location":"pvme-guides/high-tier-pvm/vorago-duo-hm/#vorago-duo-hm","text":"Duo Hardmode Overview (Originally written by Seismicity, with edits made by @!175995416955977728 ) Notes: This guide won't consist of specific ability rotations but rather ways to deal with each phase & mechanics in a fast and efficient manner. For simplicity each person will correspond with either \"Role A\" or \"Role B\". This guide also implies that whoever attempts this knows the appropriate gear and spells needed. Phase Two and Nine can be done through basic Duo Normal mode knowledge. Each Hammer uses Ingenuity Sigil unless on the rare occasion it's on cooldown phase 10 and therefore you'll need to use malevolence prayer and/or take off armor. Each Devotion is used along with intercept. Combust is a great ability when walked. Can be done by surging underneath Vorago once used and then Bladed Diving back. Deathtouch Bracelet may cause PKs during links because of its reflecting ability. Also Spellcasters cause the ability they proc on to hit instantly; if you're trying to Blitz-Sonic during reflect to be tick perfect, they will pk. T90 gloves are the safest option. Should have Blood Barrage set as your primary spell but having Blitz on bar as well can be useful in situations like after reflect.","title":"Vorago duo hm"},{"location":"pvme-guides/high-tier-pvm/vorago-duo-hm/#preset","text":"\u2b25 \u200e \u200e Seismic singularity Flanking 4 \u2b25 \u200e \u200e Rune Pouch \u2b25 \u200e \u200e Rune Pouch \u2b25 \u200e \u200e Rune Pouch (Runes for ) Phase One Role A The base tank of the phase. Stand on the TL spot to give the red to Role B. This allows you to disrupt earlier and save 5% adrenaline. \u200e \u200eStand directly south and bring Vorago south as he spawns. The timing for target cycle is when the timer hits 9.6 seconds (9 seconds if you weren't in TL spot.) Auto - Gstaff - Combust - Wild Magic. As he is about to melee you, start running east and use Corruption Blast. Run all the way into the southeast corner and asphyxiate. If done correctly, you will get a full asphyxiate off before the 2nd attack. Devotion if needed. Ingenuity hammer and bladed dive to the north to avoid the blue bomb that came with the red. At this time you can soul split and check the timer. At around :32 seconds, allow vorago to attack you once and surge west and get in the south voke spot. Turn on soulsplit and resonance + voke and as soon as Role B jumps, surge south and touch the wall. When Vorago turns around like at the end of the clip, start running back in and use meta as soon as you see Role B jump off. Voke Vorago and stand closer in than Role B. As soon as the red comes out, tank 4 blues and when the next red comes out you will be intercepted. If the phase is any longer than this, Role B will continue intercepting you. https://clips.twitch.tv/SeductiveWealthyPizzaCclamChamp Role B Be as close to tick perfect during top lure and Wild magic voke as soon as possible. If not 7 affinity stacks, ideally should Guthix Staff as well. Jump as soon as possible and spam surge. \u200e \u200eStand further out than Role A and take the first red bomb. Bladed dive under Vorago and soulsplit your hp up. When the next red bomb comes out, intercept and devotion. If the phase is any longer than this, continue intercepting Role A and use resonance when needed. Phase Two (Bring Him Down) Player B will place a dummy as the last orb is clicked; make sure it is by both players. Sun Immediately and continue building while clicking Vorago. Once it is attack-able, start with a Wild Magic and Aphyxiate, shattering during BHD if using a Pack Mammoth. Once the phase is over it is very helpful to use Natural instinct on the dummy as Vorago lands his second jump (there are three jumps in total). Phase 3 (Ceiling Collapse) Role A Pre Sunshine Dropdown near the center and build with a defensive and adrenaline potion. Pre Reflect rotation should consist of a wildmagic and guthix staff. During reflect devotion Role B and Detonate. Post Reflect aphyxiate and continue Dpsing. Run out far enough to receive the Redbomb and go under Vorago after your sunshine runs out. SGB spec after sunshine. Ideally should phase Pre Reflect but if not run underneath vorago on the second reflect and intercept Role B using reflect. Phase soon after. Role B Very similar to Role A. \u200e \u200eSunshine dropdown near the center. Auto Dbreath (Voke) Wild Magic Combust Hammer. Detonate during reflect. Release Detonate with an Auto and Dbreath, start running under vorago Corruption Blast and Combust and Bladed dive back to sunshine. Run in to give the Redbomb to Role A and then use devotion. Dps until Phased and if not pre reflect provoke the boss for Role A. Notes: Using Resonance on the third blue is ideal. Can resonance again post Red or re-Disrupt. Phase 4 (Scopulus) Role A : Stand northwest on drop. Vuln Wildmagic and run towards Role B. Asphyxiate until you are barricaded and then charge Detonate when scopulus are stacked. Tsunami when 100% adrenaline and Bladed dive back towards the north wall and continue running along the walls in a circle. Limitless Devotion Player B as soon as possible and continue 4-Tick Baraging and using thresholds. Build to Cade when Player B uses devotion and barricade after and start building back to 100 for Vit phase. This is a good point to stop running and provoke the Scops in order to restack them. Soon after cade runs out the phase should be over but if prolonged then can use Reflect. Role B : Go near West Scopulus spawn near the south wall. Vuln Wildmagic the West scop and run towards Role A on the west side. Barricade a little bit after first blue as this allows Role A to Dps longer without having to run away. Vuln the East Scop as soon as possible to have both south Scopulus aggro and then Provoke the north in an attempt to stack all three. Run towards role A when barricade has a few seconds left. Use as many thresholds as possible and devotion after player A does so. Can aphyxiate if there is a good distance between you and the Scopulus (Not recommended if intercepted by the other player). Reflect is phase is prolonged. Notes: Use this order of Barricade and Devotion as is most optimal for Vitalis phase cooldowns. Taunting perk is very useful on an Enhanced Excalibur or in place of Enhanced Devoted. Try staying within this cone when running the scopulus. If you are out of this area, you risk losing all 3 of the scops being stacked on a single square. The easiest way to keep them stacked is to coordinate when you break off DD with your partner and to bomb each other when devotion/caded. Phase 5 (Vitalis) Role A Have intercept ready on drop. Target cycle Hammer dropdown and use devotion, provoke and sunshine immediately while still gaining adrenaline with defensives until reflect ends. Typical Sunshine rotation while maintaining aggro or provoking if needed. Takes bleeds 1-4 and freedom 4th. During cade cast heal other on player B. Continue Dpsing until the phase is over before the second reflect. Role B Sun on dropdown, Dbreath Corruption Asphyxiate and Impact (flank) and use Devotion on reflect. Continue building on reflect with defensives and if provoke is used let Role A know to provoke. Wild magic and build to barricade. Definitely avoid solids like soups as the adren loss can result in the loss of the kill. Once bleeds start Barricade Role A and cast heal other. Voke the 5th bleed and reequip staff/duel wield. Continue Dpsing until phase is over. Notes: Do not move after the phase has ended, or you will not be able to heal your partner as you will be blocked by Vitalis If using a Pack Mammoth the Vitalis are capable of blocking you and your familiar meaning the Summoning Special will not work. To resonance (heal) a blue, you must disruption shield on the same tick, otherwise it is just reducing damage, as there are 2 blues. One missed Pray flick is practically death. In order to flank on this phase, stand in the squares marked with colored circles. The blue circle would be able to use flank, so red must have Vorago provoked. Phase 6 (Green Bomb) (Most Optimal) Role A: Sunshine Dropdown and use corrupt before reflect. If player B used devotion on the previous phase you will be the one tanking the first Greenbomb. Build to devotion and if on Player B use it. If it isn\u2019t, use either disruption shield or shield dome to tank both the Greenbomb and the blue following it. Alternatively, if player B did not use Devotion they will instead tank the first Greenbomb while player A can threshold. Resonance during reflect and detonate. Continue using thresholds and if you did not tank the first bomb you will tank the second. Run out to receive the redbomb if you did not tank the second. Optionally can reprisal this redbomb. Should not get a third greenbomb and if so use your best judgement on how to handle it. Role B: Hammer dropdown with provoke and then walk a combust. Build to sunshine if devotion is on cooldown. If it happens to be available you will tank the first greenbomb. Tank using disruption shield and/or shield dome if on yourself or devotion if on Player A. During reflect continue building using defensives. Use thresholds like wild magic but keep your adrenaline high if you are tanking the second greenbomb. If the Greenbomb is on yourself use devotion without intercepting and reprisal. Disrupt the blue following the greenbomb and keep your Lifepoints high. If the Greenbomb is on player A repeat the same thing except using intercept. Walk in as to not obtain the redbomb. Use thresholds like aphyxiate until the phase is over. Notes: Before the phase make sure your life points are above 10,000. This phase may require some improvisation so use your best judgement. Optionally you may use Barricade or Immortality however this guide covers the more optimal rotation. (Safer) Role A: Guthix staff then corrupt, build to 100% and either barricade if Greenbomb is on Player B or sunshine if on yourself. Build adren during reflect and thresh afterwards. If the second Greenbomb is on Player B then devotion and reprisal. Run in to not receive Redbomb if just tanked a Green. If there\u2019s a third Greenbomb then use immortality or reflect. Safer to just threshold if you did not sun during the first Greenbomb. Role B: Hammer Dropdown, combust, and then build to 100%. Immortality if on Role A or sunshine if not. Use Devotion to handle the second Greenbomb and reprisal if on Player A or continue threshing if on yourself. Barricade can be used to handle the third Greenbomb. Phase 7 (TeamSplit) Role A Charge Detonate and release with a hammer (if doable) on dropdown, otherwise release with auto Dbreath. Wild Magic (Hammer if not already) and sit under Vorago. Sunshine asap and Adren pot + Reprisal and disrupt the first blue, devotion the 2nd blue and dump threshes, impact flank as often as possible. Role B Charge Detonate and release with auto and guthix staff on dropdown. Build during TS and Auto WM voke out of ts, using Resonance on the third blue. Immediately use Devotion, step closer to Vorago, sunshine auto Dbreath. Build during TS and Reprisal, disrupting the first blue and using thresholds Notes: Resonance can be used on the third blue bomb and disrupt may be used during the second teamsplit to save food. If used before, the teamsplit will negate it. Phase 8 (The End) Role A: Thresh During the first quadrant and then prepare to devotion or barricade depending on what bomb type is in the second quadrant.

Whether blue or reds come first does not matter as long as you tag blues instantly and wait a few seconds before tagging red bombs.This allows Player A\u2019s cade to last as long as possible. Sunshine around the third quadrant and continue building until standup. Thresh until reflect and provoke the boss. Detonate after reflect ends and build adren until the second rotation. Thresh during the first quadrant and be ready to intercept player A. Devotion blue bombs and barricade redbombs. Once Stand up starts the second time, use any thresholds to finish the phase. Notes: if a third rotation is needed it can be handled like the first. Phase 9 (Waterfall) Simply do the same things as you would on P4 NM, as detailed in <#534533462430973952> or <#645460937473785886>. Focus on food preservation and sharding on CD. Make sure to summon your nihil out of your mammoth at the end of P9. Phase 10 Notes: Role A and B vary only slightly. Use disruption shield when Role B goes to reprisal the broken teamsplit.

Teamsplit: While being close during Purple Bomb was optimal, you still want to be far out during this teamsplit. Wait for the release of the first blue and run back to any Suns if need be. Reprisal this Teamsplit as often as possible. If manually triggered the tick before teamsplit, reprisal will hit immediately after and push before the first blue bomb. If you are the Cader, use the same idea as Phase 10 however it is imperative that the initial intercept is early (same timing as P10 intercept). If intercepted too late, the re-intercept will also be later and you\u2019ll find yourself tanking two Purple Bombs post reflect. The non-cader will use the best thresholds available and then Hammer either just before reflect or the very start. Mauling: If you found yourself needing this I don\u2019t think I need to explain it.

This guide assumes that both players have reasonable knowledge and understanding of Vorago's mechanics, such as clearing bleeds, how to deal with weekly mechanics, reflect timings, etc. It is recommended to practice these in larger team sizes before attempting to duo. Target cycling is a pivotal tactic at Vorago, and rotations in this guide are written to take advantage of it. For more information on target cycling, refer to <#538730485095071765>. All phases can be completed without the usage of target cycling, however, some will be significantly slower. A player\u2019s default hit chance at Vorago is relatively poor, which is why on top of Auras, Overloads, Reaper Necklace, and Nihils, special attack weapons such as the Statius Warhammer and Guthix Staff have immense value. To optimize your duos significantly, it is recommended that both players acquire/unlock both special attacks (Ingenuity of the Humans is required for using SWH with magic or ranged). The usage of the Statius Warhammer and Seren Godbow special attacks, along with the Ingenuity of the Humans sigil, are included in most rotations in this guide. Seren Godbow special attack can be replaced with your most powerful available threshold. Please refer to the dpm advice guides for more information on ability prioritisation.

This will cause Vorago to walk away from the spot which the TL will land on, stalling his attacks slightly. By stepping 1 square forward, you will prevent Vorago from walking over you. It is unnecessary to walk 1 square forward if you escape with dual wield ranged.

This has major impact on Team Split and Purple Bomb week P3s. \u2022 and are available. \u2022Combat Dummies are used for weeks which they significantly affect the rotation on. Presets : General Purpose : Scopulus \u2022 should be used for P3, as this phase benefits heavily from . may also be used for P1, if not Onslaughting. Vitalis \u2022Adjust the amount of dummies based on the method you are using. \u2022 should be used on P3 for this week, if the player is inexperienced. Presets : General Purpose Vitalis Purple Bomb \u2022Scrimshaw should be used for P5 only. About Presets: \u2022As Bomb Tank , equip your , and replace the Phoenix Neckalce with a Super Saradomin Brew, which you will drink after the entry hit. \u2022Adjust the amount of food you bring according to how much you feel that you will need. If the suggested preset does not have enough food, replacing Jellies and Super Guthix Brews with Super Saradomin Brews will help. \u2022 is left out for most weeks, as it is inferior to the on all weeks except Scopulus P3. It is, however, recommended that be used for learning duo Vorago. \u2022Super Guthix Brews and Jellies should be prioritized in general, as solids like Sailfish Soup drain adrenaline, and Saradomin Brews drain stats. Bolt Usage at Vorago : \u2022 are good prior to as they will increase the damage of as well as heal you resulting in a longer lasting - should always be equipped prior to . Onyx bolts are also generally used when Vorago is under 80k on P3's, and during P2/P4. \u2022 are good when building for / on different weekly rotations, and should be used once Vorago has reached low HP on P5 during any week as rubies will not result in DPM increase at this point \u2022 are used at the start of most phases (optional P2/P4). \u2022 Black Stone Arrows are worth using if you have slower kills as the stacks will never fall off during a phase and they provide more accuracy increase than does, when above 15 stacks. However, if you have fast kills there is no point in bringing them. Miscellaneous tips for ranging at Vorago : \u2022 The correct timing for on reflect is exactly 1 tick after Voragos 2nd auto attack - this allows you to do a slow hitting ability such as on top of the before a special attack like Teamsplit/Waterfall, which will prevent you from attacking. \u2022 bug can be used on phases with additional targets to increase your DPM output substantially. This can be done on Vit week and any phases that you place a dummy down to natural instinct. This guide makes use of this in its rotations. \u2022 Playing with ability queueing allows you to 3-tick , which makes some of these rotations faster.

One player will tag 1 Red Bomb, and the other player will tag the remaining 2 Red Bombs. On stand you will each get 1 Purple Bomb only (as well as Vorago's normal attacks). Tagging no Blue Bombs, and having one player tag 1 Red Bomb, and the other player will tag the remaining 2 Red Bombs. On stand you will each get 3 Blue Bombs (as well as Vorago's normal attacks).

This method requires both players to stand next to eachother, as Vitali will block the usage of . This method is generally safer but also slower than method 2. Recommended for players learning to duo this week. The No Cade method, where players stand on opposite sides of Vorago (allowing for flanking and preventing the players from Blue Bombing eachother). This method involves both players doing full damage rotations, and using on bleeds if necessary. In general, this method is not recommended unless you are able to finish the phase within before the end of bleeds (at the very latest).

This guide assumes that both players have reasonable knowledge and understanding of Vorago's mechanics, such as clearing bleeds, how to deal with weekly mechanics, reflect timings, etc. It is recommended to practice these in larger team sizes before attempting to duo. Target cycling is a pivotal tactic at Vorago, and rotations in this guide are written to take advantage of it. For more information on target cycling, refer to <#538730485095071765>. All phases can be completed without the usage of target cycling, however, some will be significantly slower. A player\u2019s default hit chance at Vorago is relatively poor, which is why on top of Auras, Overloads, Reaper Necklace, and Nihils, special attack weapons such as the Statius Warhammer and Guthix Staff have immense value. To optimize your duos significantly, it is recommended that both players acquire/unlock both special attacks (Ingenuity of the Humans is required for using SWH with magic or ranged). The usage of the Statius Warhammer and Seren Godbow special attacks, along with the Ingenuity of the Humans sigil, are included in most rotations in this guide. Seren Godbow special attack can be replaced with your most powerful available threshold. Please refer to the dpm advice guides for more information on ability prioritisation.

This will cause Vorago to walk away from the spot which the TL will land on, stalling his attacks slightly. By stepping 1 square forward, you will prevent Vorago from walking over you. It is unnecessary to walk 1 square forward if you escape with dual wield ranged.

This has major impact on Team Split and Purple Bomb week P3s. \u2022 and are available. \u2022Combat Dummies are used for weeks which they significantly affect the rotation on. Presets : General Purpose : Scopulus \u2022 should be used for P3, as this phase benefits heavily from . may also be used for P1, if not Onslaughting. Vitalis \u2022Adjust the amount of dummies based on the method you are using. \u2022 should be used on P3 for this week, if the player is inexperienced. Presets : General Purpose Vitalis Purple Bomb \u2022Scrimshaw should be used for P5 only. About Presets: \u2022As Bomb Tank , equip your , and replace the Phoenix Neckalce with a Super Saradomin Brew, which you will drink after the entry hit. \u2022Adjust the amount of food you bring according to how much you feel that you will need. If the suggested preset does not have enough food, replacing Jellies and Super Guthix Brews with Super Saradomin Brews will help. \u2022 is left out for most weeks, as it is inferior to the on all weeks except Scopulus P3. It is, however, recommended that be used for learning duo Vorago. \u2022Super Guthix Brews and Jellies should be prioritized in general, as solids like Sailfish Soup drain adrenaline, and Saradomin Brews drain stats. Bolt Usage at Vorago : \u2022 are good prior to as they will increase the damage of as well as heal you resulting in a longer lasting - should always be equipped prior to . Onyx bolts are also generally used when Vorago is under 80k on P3's, and during P2/P4. \u2022 are good when building for / on different weekly rotations, and should be used once Vorago has reached low HP on P5 during any week as rubies will not result in DPM increase at this point \u2022 are used at the start of most phases (optional P2/P4). \u2022 Black Stone Arrows are worth using if you have slower kills as the stacks will never fall off during a phase and they provide more accuracy increase than does, when above 15 stacks. However, if you have fast kills there is no point in bringing them. Miscellaneous tips for ranging at Vorago : \u2022 The correct timing for on reflect is exactly 1 tick after Voragos 2nd auto attack - this allows you to do a slow hitting ability such as on top of the before a special attack like Teamsplit/Waterfall, which will prevent you from attacking. \u2022 bug can be used on phases with additional targets to increase your DPM output substantially. This can be done on Vit week and any phases that you place a dummy down to natural instinct. This guide makes use of this in its rotations. \u2022 Playing with ability queueing allows you to 3-tick , which makes some of these rotations faster.","title":"Vorago duo"},{"location":"pvme-guides/high-tier-pvm/vorago-duo/#phase-3","text":"Phase Breakdown: Team Split \u2192 3 Attacks \u2192 Reflect \u2192 Team Split \u2192 3 Attacks \u2192 Red Bomb \u2192 4 Attacks \u2192 Repeat Base Tank : \u200e \u200eTarget Cycle + [Team Split Start] > > > > > [Team Split End] (Bladed Dive/Surge to walk Vorago) > > > > [Reflect Start] > > (charge) [Reflect End] [Team Split Start] > > > [Team Split End] > > (walk) > > > > > Improvise.

Method Overview : Both players will use before P5 starts. The Base Tank should disrupt immediately after the last waterfall spawns on P4.

Escape, asphyx, Gstaff. Deto is done beforehand to prevent vits from cancelling during reflect. The rest of the team should be standing on the east side in MD. The base, or another DPS should voke the boss on the third auto from rago. The DPS Detonate during reflect, the bomb tanks should focus on stayling alive.

Refer to the 4man record POV linked below, as this will greatly help. The base should tank the GB, but can pass it first if it makes sense to.

Mager Tag reds (blues if you prefer it, not worth unless going for records). On first arm, do auto Asphyx, cancel asphyx with Wild Magic. The DPSer and tagging bomb tank do G Staff spec and build to 100%. Sunshine, apot, build, deto + Wild Magic, Asphyx. The tagging bomb tank cade cepts the team. P9 - Waterfall and Weekly Special This will be the same as P4 NM, aside from the differences noted above. Clone spawn will immediately asphyx. Pray magic and anticipate or freedom after the 2nd blue out of waterfall. P10 This is mechanically similar to Phase 5 of NM, but with two weekly rotations as part of the specs. The most important thing about Phase 10 is knowing when to maul on each rotation, to allow for a smoother Phase 11. If you Shield dome before you maul, the maul animation will break allowing everyone to build adren on a dummy before p11 starts. The general strategy is to use a DPS ultimate at the start, while applying all defense-reducing debuffs (vulnerability, hammer, quake, gstaff, bsa). BT's will alternate between Barricade and Sunshine out of a special attack. On link, use Storm Shards, build with defensives, and re-apply debuffs. Repeat until maul spot. Broken TeamSplits (Courtesy of @185315527571406848 ) This diagram shows which team splits will be broken in red, and in tact in blue. This is important for knowing how the TS spec will affect push. The general strategy is for the entire team to tank the TS if it's broken. If you own the Reprisal ability, however, it is a good idea to tank any TS, even ones that aren't broken, assuming your Reprisal is off cooldown. When to Maul P10 Ceilings Maul when GB comes out. P11 will start with 5 blues then Ts -> ref -> Vit Scops Maul on either PB release or TS start PB release maul gives you 5 autos->reflect->Vit TS start maul gives you 3 autos->PB->reflect->Vit Vit Maul on either PB release or on Vit release Vit release maul, 3 autos ->reflect->bleeds PB release maul, 5 autos-> Vit->reflect GB Maul GB release, gives 5 autos ->reflect->TS TS Maul as Reflect starts, gives 3 autos->PB->TS The End Maul as soon as PB comes out. P11 starts with 5 blues then ref, then vit. Note Mauling reflect on p10 is good for all weeks, this works best with shield dome though, especially if vit is first spec after reflect. P11 All adrenaline is drained from the transition between P10 to P11. Otherwise, essentially the same as P10, but with different weekly mechanics present. No constraints on when to maul, simply maul ASAP. Assuming usage of a dummy, you should build to roughly 35% without Shield Dome, or 70% with Shield Dome. Start off by immediately re-applying debuffs (vulnerability, hammer, quake, gstaff, bsa), then build to DPS ultimates. BT's once again alternate between Barricade and Sunshine depending on the special attack. If Vorago has enough Storm Shard stacks (7+), you can use Shatter while in a DPS ultimate to instantly deal 25k-30k damage, instantly applying push forward.

Pouch 1: Pouch 2: Pouch 3: Rotations for 4 or 5man (Courtesy of @373844901273796608 ) Ceilings 4-man Dummy mid on drop. BT Disrupt ASAP after the end of P2. Sunshine, apot, and build to 65% (needs enh apot, otherwise sigil). Auto Asphyx, Wild Magic, Dragon Breath, and Tuska if time (If everything was tick perfect it should be on the last tick before ref). 1 BT should be cepting the other during ref. 2 defensives, and deto for reflect. Release with DB then Asphyx + WM. Basics or Gstaff depending on adren. Hammer into Quake. Shard on reflect and build with defensives. Berserk, 2 basics, barge, apot, assault, sigil hurricane. Phase with basics or another Quake, or a forceful backhand. 5-man Don't sun, save it for scop. On drop, auto asphyx, WM, Gstaff, Dragon BReath. BTs should cept on reflect, everyone deto. From here, follow 4man rotation. Hammer + Khopesh, barge, assault bleed, quake, and cleave if he's close. Build on reflect, barge with DW, destroy, and use 188s. Build on dummy after phase. Scopulus 4-man Bomb tanks should Disrupt ASAP. Debuffs should be planned out before drop. The DPSer should be standing west of the west scop spawn. Sun off CD, and Wild Magic Deto with Sigil if you can. When the east and north scop arrive, move east, to the edge of the Sunshine to stack them. This is when you want to use detonate, and any other AoE Abilities as frequently as possible. The phase should be over after your 2nd Wild Magic. If not, use basics to phase. Dummy end if possible. 4 or 5-man Stay close to the west scop spawn and tag with mutated barge, followed by an assault and a slaughter. Switch to souls this phase. You can ZGS spec, alternatively just use scythe and Meteor Strike. Take advantage of Quake, Hurricane, Flurry, and Bladed Dive, as they are all AoEs. 5-man Both mage DPSers stand west of the west scop spawn, one debuff west and north, and the other east. Sunshine apot when you can, and straight into Wild Magic + Detonate. Release with sigil ans Asphyx. The BT and DPS on the west should focus that scop, and the BT on the south should attack east with base, then change to north. Vitalis 4-man Mager How this phase goes will depend on how quick you finished Scops. Either way, everyone in the team should be in MD, and form a diamond square around Vorago to avoid crossbombing If you can Sunshine then do so, if not then threshold. 5-man Mager If you are bomb tanking, detonate before dropdown on the L crack, and release with a Wild Magic. Escape, asphyx, Gstaff. Deto is done beforehand to prevent vits from cancelling during reflect. The rest of the team should be standing on the east side in MD. The base, or another DPS should voke the boss on the third auto from rago. The DPS Detonate during reflect, the bomb tanks should focus on stayling alive. DPS should follow the same rotation as bomb tanks, in general. Second set of Wild Magic and Asphyx after reflect to finish the phase. Build on vits. 5-man Melee Hammer, Quake, Hurricane, 188s, off. Build, barge, Assault, 188s, Hurricane or Quake to finish phase. Build on vits. Green Bomb 5-man Mager Disrupt on dropdown if you are a bomb tank. Onslaught and don't die. Cancel the Onslaught with either a resonance or a Dragon Breath followed by a resonance. Finish with strong basics. 5-man Melee Have aggro on vit before drop. Berserk when you land, and build with defensives. DO NOT lose target. A DPSer should place a dummy close to MD, and you can barge this. If not, barge Rago and Sigil Assault Hurricane, followed by a quake. This should finish the phase. Build on a dummy as high as you can. 4-man : You can either Onslaught or Sunshine. Refer to the 4man record POV linked below, as this will greatly help. The base should tank the GB, but can pass it first if it makes sense to. If the team opts to sunshine, the meleer can devo and intercept the bomb tanks. The DPSers should generally still Onslaught. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgS_YH8PG2A&feature=youtu.be Team Split 4 or 5-man Mager The bomb tanks should Sunshine drop, with the help of a dummy and adrenaline potion. Run to the first TeamSplit, and get back into Sunshine ASAP. Use Wild Magic, Dragon Breath, Asphyx, Resonance, and get off. Deto during reflect with Dragon Breath. Eat up to 9k+, Disrupt + Reprisal, release, Wild Magic + Asphyx to finish phase. \u200e \u200eMeleer Barge, Hammer, Assault, Quake, and use 188s. On reflect, voke, build with defensives, spellbook swap, auto + hurricane, reprisal + disrupt, auto, use 188s, and finish with a forceful backhand. The End Meleer Hammer Spec, Quake, Hurricane, Build to 100%, Berserk, Auto + Cleave. Build with defensives on reflect, barge, Assault, Hurricane. Mager Tag reds (blues if you prefer it, not worth unless going for records). On first arm, do auto Asphyx, cancel asphyx with Wild Magic. The DPSer and tagging bomb tank do G Staff spec and build to 100%. Sunshine, apot, build, deto + Wild Magic, Asphyx. The tagging bomb tank cade cepts the team. P9 - Waterfall and Weekly Special This will be the same as P4 NM, aside from the differences noted above. Clone spawn will immediately asphyx. Pray magic and anticipate or freedom after the 2nd blue out of waterfall. P10 This is mechanically similar to Phase 5 of NM, but with two weekly rotations as part of the specs. The most important thing about Phase 10 is knowing when to maul on each rotation, to allow for a smoother Phase 11. If you Shield dome before you maul, the maul animation will break allowing everyone to build adren on a dummy before p11 starts. The general strategy is to use a DPS ultimate at the start, while applying all defense-reducing debuffs (vulnerability, hammer, quake, gstaff, bsa). BT's will alternate between Barricade and Sunshine out of a special attack. On link, use Storm Shards, build with defensives, and re-apply debuffs. Repeat until maul spot. Broken TeamSplits (Courtesy of @185315527571406848 ) This diagram shows which team splits will be broken in red, and in tact in blue. This is important for knowing how the TS spec will affect push. The general strategy is for the entire team to tank the TS if it's broken. If you own the Reprisal ability, however, it is a good idea to tank any TS, even ones that aren't broken, assuming your Reprisal is off cooldown. When to Maul P10 Ceilings Maul when GB comes out. P11 will start with 5 blues then Ts -> ref -> Vit Scops Maul on either PB release or TS start PB release maul gives you 5 autos->reflect->Vit TS start maul gives you 3 autos->PB->reflect->Vit Vit Maul on either PB release or on Vit release Vit release maul, 3 autos ->reflect->bleeds PB release maul, 5 autos-> Vit->reflect GB Maul GB release, gives 5 autos ->reflect->TS TS Maul as Reflect starts, gives 3 autos->PB->TS The End Maul as soon as PB comes out. P11 starts with 5 blues then ref, then vit. Note Mauling reflect on p10 is good for all weeks, this works best with shield dome though, especially if vit is first spec after reflect. P11 All adrenaline is drained from the transition between P10 to P11. Otherwise, essentially the same as P10, but with different weekly mechanics present. No constraints on when to maul, simply maul ASAP. Assuming usage of a dummy, you should build to roughly 35% without Shield Dome, or 70% with Shield Dome. Start off by immediately re-applying debuffs (vulnerability, hammer, quake, gstaff, bsa), then build to DPS ultimates. BT's once again alternate between Barricade and Sunshine depending on the special attack. If Vorago has enough Storm Shard stacks (7+), you can use Shatter while in a DPS ultimate to instantly deal 25k-30k damage, instantly applying push forward.

These tips can range from very helpful (to the point where dps strategies rely on them) to just knowing them for the sake of trivia. These are generally organized by phase. Some of this information is already listed on the RS Wiki but for the sake of completion I will reiterate them here. This is not an extensive list of all glitches and misc. tips as I\u2019m sure there are more to be discovered. Unless stated otherwise, all of these apply to both normal mode and hard mode. \u2b25 Pre-Fight \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e \u2022 Challenge Timer \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e - Vorago\u2019s fight challenge operates on a timer of 20 seconds. If you teleport away after you\u2019ve accepted Vorago\u2019s challenge to fight, and you travel back to the Face area within the 20 seconds, Vorago will still start the encounter and bring everyone into P1. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e - Potential application: If you teleport away, do not return to the Face area within 20 seconds unless you wish to join the fight. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e \u2022 Fake Dropdown \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e - There are some methods wherein you can take the dropdown damage but not enter the fight. One method of doing so is to open the \u201cchange username\u201d interface, though you do not need to change your username \u2013 just have the interface open. The dropdown damage will still calculate as if you will join the fight (eg. In a team of five, the dropdown damage will be 10k even though only four people enter the kill). \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e - Potential application: This could be used to lessen dropdown damage without having to enter p1 and lobby thereafter, in the event you need to get someone with low HP into the fight. \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e \u2022 Rest Animation \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e - If you are in a rest animation when someone initiates the fight challenge prompt, you will not receive the challenge prompt until you have left the rest animation. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e - Potential application: Don\u2019t accidentally not accept the challenge prompt by resting at Face. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e \u2022 Lucky and Dropdown Damage \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e - The Lucky perk can proc on the dropdown damage. Defenders and Armor set effects such as the Saradomin Warpriest effect can also proc on the dropdown damage nulling it to 1. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e - Potential applications: Get lucky and take 1 damage instead of 12500. This is unlikely to be useful for regular kills however. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e \u2022 Powerburst of vitality \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e - Dropdown is 20 seconds after challenge, so you can time using the powerburst of vitality by using a defensive ability like Preparation. Then right when it has some time before it comes back, you can use the powerburst right then to start the fight with more health than if you just used a phoenix necklace. You can also bring only one dose if you don't need it for the rest of the kill so you can equip your 2h weapons without needing to eat something else. \u2b25 Phase 1 \u2022 Less Bombs on P1 \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e - Once the TL5 reaches the top rock and vokes Vorago, Vorago will throw less auto attacks and often have a longer delay between auto attacks, provided no one else is standing in MD (ie. Base should not voke and stand MD until around 30k hp). \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e - Potential application: In trios, this lessens the number of blues and red bombs the Bomb Tank has to take during P1 \u2022 TL5 Corner and Attack Range \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e - Assuming the Base lures Vorago to the North West quadrant so that the TL5 takes bombs as he climbs to the voke spot, the far North West corner of the TL5 path is often too far away from Vorago\u2019s attack range. Thus, if the TL5 spends too long in the corner of the North West section, Vorago will start throwing bombs to the next furthest person which is usually the Bomb Tank. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e - Potential application: The TL5 should run past the North West corner as fast as possible to avoid sending bombs to the Bomb Tank in trios. \u200e\u2022 How to Lobby P1 \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e - If the TL5 is standing on the top platform and vokes Vorago, the rest of the team can run to the South wall and exit combat to lobby. Vorago may throw occasionally throw blue bombs to the people running Southward, though, he will do it so infrequently that you should still be able to lobby in between blue bombs. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e - Potential application: Lobby p1 if someone dies and you don\u2019t want to invest more to further the kill. \u2022 Jump Damage Null \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e - Upon the TL5 clicking to jump on Vorago, all incoming damage will be nulled on the tick when the TL5 clicks to jump. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e - Potential application: If Vorago is close to HP reset and the TL5 sees someone doing a wild magic that will reset the HP, the TL5 can click to jump and immediately null any incoming damage, preventing an HP reset. \u2022 TL5 Staying in Combat \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e - The jump animation is exactly 17 seconds. As the TL5, it is possible to stay in combat during the jump animation. This requires the TL5 to do an ability on the tick you click to jump. If you do an ability and wait a couple ticks before jump, you will have exited combat and lost adren during the jump animation. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e - Potential application: This is a way for the TL5 to keep adren during jump and threshold after jump to end p1 faster. \u200e\u2022 Movement after Jump \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e - If the Base moves away from MD during the jump animation, Vorago will follow the Base as if Vorago is still in MD. However, Vorago will not visibly move as he is stuck in the jump animation. After the jump animation is over and the TL5 reaches the ground, Vorago\u2019s character will \u201cteleport\u201d to be MD of where-ever the Base has walked to. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e - Potential application: In duos, the Base can escape during the jump animation. If the Bomb/TL5 happens to have a red bomb on them, the red bomb won\u2019t deal 3k damage as the Base is far enough away. Be sure to walk one step north after you\u2019ve escaped to prevent Vorago from moonwalking around the Base. \u2022 Movement after Jump part 2 \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e - After Vorago has moved to the Base\u2019s MD post-jump, Vorago will not move from that location unless the Base steps under him. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e - Potential application: If no one is standing MD, Vorago will continue to throw blue bombs to the Bomb Tank. The Base can step away from Vorago\u2019s MD and devo-cept the Bomb Tank. \u2022 1 HP Glitch \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e - Vorago will regenerate HP on phase 1 at 1:09 (also 2:09, 3:09, etc.), if Vorago regenerates HP while jumping around before the phase transition, Vorago can have random aggro at the start of p2 meaning the first bleed on p2 will also be to a random person. Vorago can also start throwing blues and potentially reds. The blue and red bombs can follow you through the phase transition damage you upon p2 dropdown. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e - Potential applications: The Base should target cycle as soon as possible on p2 to ensure that Base has aggro on p2. \u2b25 Phase 2 \u2022 Invisible First Bleed \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e - The first bleed of P2 does not have a character animation as Vorago is still in his dropdown animation. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e - Potential application: Clear the first bleed by using freedom first, then tag and voke if you are the Base. \u2022 1 Tick Bleed Clear \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e - It is possible to clear the bleed in 1 tick by first escaping, then bladed diving back onto Vorago within the same tick. You must target Vorago with the bladed dive, targeting the ground for MD will not work and will make Vorago walk towards you. You must avoid standing on the corner of Vorago\u2019s MD as this will also make Vorago walk toward you after you\u2019ve escaped. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e - Potential application: This is another way to keep Vorago in Base spot while clearing bleeds without freedom. \u2022 Instant Bleed Clear \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e - After a bleed is applied, there is a couple ticks delay between when the bleed is applied to when the dismember icon appears on the debuff bar. It is possible to clear a bleed before the dismember bleed icon appears on your debuff bar. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e - Potential application: You can clear bleeds faster than you think. \u2022 . Voke Splash \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e - It is possible to have a voke splash on P2, and (likely) all other phases of the boss too. If a player vokes Vorago and another player is standing within the path of Vorago and the voker, Vorago will aggro onto the person standing in-between instead. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e - Potential applications: Avoid voking Vorago while standing behind another player. See clip: https://clips.twitch.tv/FrigidDeafMooseThisIsSparta \u200e\u2022 Clearing All Bleeds Solo \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e - It is possible to clear all five bleeds solo. The order is escape/surge, bladed dive, freedom, escape/surge, bladed dive. Note a mobile perk is needed. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e - Potential application: Clear all five bleeds solo in case of dead teammates. \u2022 2k Typeless Damage \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e - Sometimes, after Bring Him Down, all players in the arena will take a 2k typeless hit immediately after the spam click mechanic. It is unclear what triggers this though it is believe to be an \u201canti-afk\u201d where if players ignore Vorago for too long, Vorago will perform the 2k typeless hit (similar to how you must stay in combat in Yaka). This 2k typeless hit can also be encountered during P1 if the TL5 vokes Vorago and everyone else lobbies, but the TL5 stays in the kill and exits combat. The TL5 will proceed to take 2k typeless hits. It seems the entire team must exit combat for this bleed to occur, though confirmation on this is needed. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e - Potential applications: Keep above 2k HP after Bring Him Down just in case. \u2022 Stuck Under Vorago \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e - During Bring Him Down, it is possible to get stuck under Vorago after the spam click mechanic. This is usually triggered by standing under Vorago during the Bring Him Down mechanic. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e - Potential applications: Avoid standing under Vorago during Bring Him Down. \u200e\u2022 Bring Him Down \u2013 DPS Check \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e - The Bring Him Down DPS check to make Vorago stumble is 50k Hp no matter the team size. This is rather trivial to do in a team size of 3+ but becomes harder in Duos. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e - Potential applications: Do approx. 50k worth of damage during Bring Him Down to get past the mechanic. \u2022 Bring Him Down \u2013 Staying in Combat \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e - Occasionally, it is possible to exit combat and drop adren during the Bring Him Down spam click mechanic. This usually occurs when players have refreshed their combat state before the last Gravity Orb is tagged. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e - Potential applications: To avoid dropping combat and losing adren during Bring Him Down, do a defensive ability during the spam click mechanic, such as anticipate. \u2b25 Phase 3 \u2022 Scopulus \u2013 Aggro \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e - The Scopulus aggro seem to be random though there are a couple ways to trigger a reaggro. 1) If a player is constantly in motion, the Scopulus tend to aggro them more. 2) A player with an Ice Nihil will tend to draw more aggro, due to the Ice Nihil\u2019s special effect acting on the Scops. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e - Potential applications: Bring a Smoke Nihil on Scop rotations to avoid drawing aggro. \u2022 Vitalis \u2013 Base Spot and Vitalis Spawn \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e - If Vorago is not moved from the initial dropdown spot, the Vitalis Orb will always be sent North, North East, or East. If Vorago is moved from the initial dropdown spot, the Vitalis Orb can be send in any direction. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e - Potential application: Avoid moving Vorago to have a predictable Vitalis Orb spawn. \u200e\u2022 Vitalis \u2013 Max Vitalis \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e - The maximum number of Vitalis that can fill the room in Normal Mode is 15, the max in Hard Mode is 25. In Normal Mode, the number of Vitalis spawning per Orb is 5 on p3 and p4, and 2-4 on p5. In Hard Mode, there are 7 Vitalis on p5 and p9, and between 3 to 5 on p10 and p11. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e - Potential applications: If you want to block all Vitalis spawns, have the appropriate number of people standing in the spawn Orb. \u2022 Vitalis \u2013 Death Animation \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e - A Vitalis minion is still treated as a physical object while in its death animation. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e - Potential application: If surrounded by Vitali, be vary of their death animations still counting as a physical object. Same applies to Waterfall on P4, your character will attempt to path around the dying Vitalis which may lead to exiting the waterfall prematurely. See clip: https://youtu.be/-HOB3kLpHgI \u200e\u2022 Teamsplit \u2013 Auto Attacks \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e - During the teamsplit mechanic, if you attempt to cast an auto attack on Vorago while outside the max cast distance, your character will run into the max cast distance in an attempt to cast your spell. Often times this results in a player leaving the teamsplit box early and taking 8k damage. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e - Potential application: Do not attempt to auto cast while in teamsplit unless you are certain you are within 7 squares to Vorago. \u2022 Teamsplit \u2013 Hard Mode \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e - The teamsplit boxes in hardmode, although appearing to be only 1x1, are actually 1x2. The square directly east of the 1x1 square is also safe to stand on. The same applies to the teamsplit boxes on p10 and p11. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e - Potential application: Another safe square to stand on for team split. \u2022 The End \u2013 Glitch out of Arms \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e - It is possible to glitch out of the arms during the mechanic by standing directly on the South line, or East line, in the respective quadrants. When Vorago\u2019s arm crosses said line, your character is free to move out into the open arena. Note that if you do not move after \u201cglitching out\u201d and stay standing on the South or East line, you will be forced back into the arms mechanic. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e - Potential applications: DPS can glitch out of arms and set up their Sun with ample space. \u2022 The End \u2013 Bombs after Phase \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e - Vorago only allows bombs to be interacted with when it is pointed to in their respective quadrant. If Vorago happens to phase while looking at a specific quadrant, the bombs in that quadrant can still be activated while the phase transition is happening. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e - Potential applications: Tag the red bombs during a phase transition and ask for a group hug. \u2b25 Phase 4 \u2022 Waterfall \u2013 First Spawn \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e - The first spawn of the waterfall will never be on the North East corner of the arena. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e - Potential applications: That is one less corner you have to consider for waterfall upon dropdown. \u2022 Waterfall \u2013 Auto Attacks \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e - Initiating an auto attack while standing in waterfall will force your character to run into max cast distance and often outside of the waterfall. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e - Potential applications: Avoid using auto attacks on Vorago while standing in waterfall. \u2022 Waterfall \u2013 Corners of the Waterfall \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e - The corners of the waterfall (excluding the NE, SE, NW, SW corner) are not considered part of the waterfall. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e - Potential application: Avoid standing on the edge/corners of the waterfall or else be ready to take a 9800 hit. \u200e\u2022 Stone Clone \u2013 Vorago Melee Animation \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e - Upon summoning a stone clone, Vorago will perform a melee swipe animation. This melee swipe animation is non-damaging and is only cosmetic. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e - Potential applications: Do not try to res this attack as it won\u2019t hit anything. \u2022 Stone Clone \u2013 No target \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e - If the stone clone target dies on the same tick, or shortly after the stone clone spawns, the stone clone will stand idle for a couple seconds before reaggroing to another person. However, the new player cannot attack the stone clone back as they are not the stone clones\u2019 original target. The stone clone will eventually despawn. \u2022 Teamsplit \u2013 Third Waterfall \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e - The teamsplit mechanic after the third waterfall is currently glitched. Vorago is still attackable during the teamsplit and if attacked, Vorago will proceed with his rotation and throw three blues, followed by bleeds. This means the team will have to tank 3 blues without any defensives and be ready to immediately deal with bleeds out of team split. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e - Potential applications: DO NOT ATTACK Vorago as teamsplit is about to spawn. This prevents Vorago from sending blues during the teamsplit. \u2b25 Phase 5 \u2022 Walking MD \u2013 Revo Friendly \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e - A player can spam click the ground behind Vorago to make their character stand MD while also stopping revo from attacking. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e - Potential application: Good for revo users to MD and be ready to clear bleeds on tick. \u2022 P5 Voke \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e - Due to how P5 is set up, a player cannot voke Vorago during p5. The ability will simply not activate when pressed. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e - Potential application: None. \u2022 Melee Dismember on Reflects \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e - If a player applies the dismember melee ability on reflects to another player, and the victim player receives the first bleed, the first bleed damage will immediately apply the 4500 damage as if the player was taking a second bleed from Vorago without clearing the first bleed. This is most likely an oversight. It is unknown if this works on p2, p3, and p4. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e - Potential applications: Prank your teammates by putting a dismember on them during reflects. \u200e\u2022 Stall and Auto Attacks \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Vorago begins his attack pattern the tick after the target cycle tick. His attack speed varies: \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- His attack speed will be 4 ticks if the last action he performed was either being pushed forwards or being pushed back \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- His attack speed will be 3 ticks if the last action he performed was attacking, whether it be a special attack, blue bomb, or melee swipe. This includes if he pushes and attacks in the same tick. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- As you can attack Vorago on the target cycle tick, which is before he releases the first spec, you can delay the release of the first special attack. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Potential applications: 0-Linking green bomb/vitalis; 0-Specing \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Vorago can only be pushed once in either direction on any given tick. \u200e\u2022 Damaged Required to Push \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Pushing Vorago one tile entails dealing 20k damage to him. As soon as this 20k threshold is hit, the damage counter resets to 0 for the next tile. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- For example, if you deal one hit of damage that deals 30k damage to Vorago, 30k damage is added to the damage counter, then the game performs a check to see if that total value is at least 20k. It finds that 30,000 >= 20,000 holds true, so Vorago pushes a tile and then the counter is reset to 0, effectively losing 10,000 damage. This 10,000 damage is referred to as \u201coverkill\u201d. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- As an alternative example, presume you deal three individual hits of 10,000 damage on the same tick. The first one is added to the damage counter, it checks if 10,000 >= 20,000 and finds that is false, so that hit doesn\u2019t cause it to push. The next hit is then added to the damage counter, which is now at 20,000 damage. It checks if 20,000 >= 20,000 and finds that is true, so the boss pushes and resets the damage counter to 0. Finally, the last hit of 10,000 is added to the damage counter, and it performs the same check, but finds that 10,000 >= 20,000 does not hold true. This 10,000 damage stays in the damage counter until the next tick, and this damage is referred to as \u201coverflow\u201d. So the result of these hits is pushing one tile with 10,000 overflow. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- As a final example, suppose there is one last hit of 10,000 damage on that tick. Again, this 10,000 is added to the damage counter as before, for a total of 20,000 damage. The game performs the same check and finds that 20,000 is in fact at least 20,000, so the damage counter resets. Vorago cannot be pushed twice on the same tick, so hitting this 40,000 damage mark in one tick may actively be detrimental to a kill, as you will end up losing 20,000 damage.

You can take advantage of this by using the spell Heal Other from the Lunar Spellbook and cast the heal at the same time as a phase transition. Normally, Heal Other will take hp from your character and transfer it to your target player; this results in a large 3-7k typeless \"hit\" on your character that is unavoidable. However, as your character is immune during a phase transition, the Heal Other will not damage your character. Thus, your target player will gain hp at no cost to you. This works on any phase transition at Vorago in both normal mode and hard mode (with the exception of p10 -> p11 at hard mode). How to perform a crack heal: 1) Be on the Lunar Spellbook and select the spell Heal Other 2) Click your target player when the floor shows cracks, right before it collapses Note: Your target player must have Accept Aid turned ON in their settings. Note: if you mess up and perform the Heal Other too early/late, the spell will take hp from your character and transfer it to your target. Note: Heal Group can be used as well, though it requires your target player(s) to be within 1 square of you. Easiest way to achieve this is to ask your partner to follow you, or vice versa. See video for examples: https://youtu.be/3bMTu1YJIbQ Tutorial on 14k entry hits Bonfire with all of your HP-boosting gear; if you have a thermal flask, use it prior to bonfiring Load your preset with your shield equipped Activate Fortitude Eat a rocktail/sailfish soup Lobby You should be 14k+ hp without needing to keep prayer activated, just don't take off any hp boosting items (e.g. shield) or load another preset, else your hp disappears Skipping Debilitate on P5 @175995416955977728 Debilitate should be skipped after bleeds because while it does have a chance of blocking push back, it can negatively impact stall. This is most notable on the TeamSplit rotation because the person who suns relies heavily on stall to use their threshes before TeamSplit. While this is not as harmful on other rotations, it may still prevent players from using the full duration of their sunshine. The dps of two or three players is typically greater than Vorago's push back. Thus, it is better to skip debilitate in favor of higher damage abilities to both induce stall from taking damage and dealing more damage overall. 1st blue sent out 2nd blue sent out 1st blue hits and creates stall 2nd blue hits and creates stall 3rd blue sent out Teamsplit 3rd blue hits and creates stall (while he is no longer attackable) In the above scenario Vorago pushes back 3 times and you can only take advantage of 2 times he stalls, 2 of which are 3 ticks apart. Now lets look at what Debilitating does. 1st blue sent out 2nd blue sent out 1st blue hits 3rd blue sent out 2nd blue hits and creates stall Teamsplit 3rd blue hits and creates stall (while he is no longer attackable) Debilitating prevents the first blue from stalling vorago which means that the third blue gets sent out, allowing his teamsplit attack to happen much earlier If you have disruption shield, it is best to use it on the second blue and to asphyxiate instead of debilitating. If you push Vorago after he sends out the third blue, you have a chance to take advantage of the stall from the last blue rather than getting pushed while he TeamSplits. How to DD Scops on spawn using Backwards Target Cycle https://youtu.be/KmYgKcfLeRc Getting flank on scops as base (Courtesy of @292744647850065920 ) Stand on the tile shown in the video, and take one step north east after luring scops. https://youtu.be/UtBBbOpRx84 (Clip courtesy of @184952892422094848 ) Breaking Teamsplits (Courtesy of @!129324652114739200 ) \u201cBreaking\u201d a teamsplit involves Vorago continuing his attack rotation during a teamsplit. This is beneficial during phase 4, as it can speed up the phase. However, this is harmful on phases 3 and 5, as it gives you less time to attack the boss. When the teamsplit is broken, Vorago can still use both melee attacks and blue bombs, so keep in mind to eat up if necessary to not die to this. To break the teamsplit, you need to use mutated barge and then apply one of your melee channeled abilities as a bleed directly before the teamsplit. It does not matter which ability you use (flurry, assault, or destroy), however the tick that you apply the bleed on DOES effect how quickly the teamsplit is broken. Some ticks result in attacks starting slower during the teamsplit, meaning the phases lasts longer, where others result in the attacks starting sooner in teamsplit, meaning the phase doesn\u2019t last as long. \u200e \u200eA consistent way break the teamsplit on a fast tick is to barge immediately after the 6th blue bomb is released after the clone and then bleed destroy exactly one global cooldown later. Keep in mind to stop attacking before your barge to get the buff. If done correctly, bleeds will come immediately after a phase 4 teamsplit. The first bleed received is somewhat invisible, similar to the first bleed on phase 2, so make sure to watch out for that. In addition, you can sometimes lose aggro, so make sure to voke. Both barge and the bleed following can splash and you will still break the teamsplit. Video example of a slow vs fast broken teamsplit (left side is the correct timing): https://youtu.be/5MMV0_JraMw Target Cycling at Vorago (Courtesy of @175995416955977728 ) Target cycling is extremely useful at Vorago for multiple reasons. It allows you to attack both scopulus on spawn, luring them extremely easily without issue. It can also let you attack Vorago before he becomes immune to a dropdown special attack, like the first waterfall, TeamSplit, or Purple Bomb. On the final phase, you can push forward Vorago before he does a dropdown special attack, which creates push stall, allowing you to do an additional ability. In order to target cycle Vorago on tick properly, you must know 2 important timings. Timing 1 : Phase Transition 'Crack' This timing is very easy, as the crack animation is 3 ticks long, and you just need to use movement ability like Surge, Escape, or Bladed Dive on the third tick. Alternatively, you can use Provoke on a training dummy/Vitalis, or learn the timing with any other ability such as anticipate, although the easiest and most beneficial one is to use Escape, as that let's you easily cast Heal Other while staying in range of your partner. The first tick is when the crack first appears, and the third tick is when you use surge. To help, set a metronome to 100 bpm, count to 2 when the crack appears, then use surge. Once you get the timing down in your head it is hard to mess up during the kill. Timing 2 : Mobile Cooldown Cooldowns go around 360 degrees on your abilities clockwise, and keeping clocks in mind, we can use this to help make learning the target cycle timing much easier. 9 seconds after your surge/escape with mobile perk, your ability will be at 10 o' clock on 1 tick and 11 o'clock on another tick. On 11 o'clock you need to press target cycling and an instant hitting ability to follow (like dragon breath) (See image below) Centering Vorago @!414995552393232394 and @175995416955977728 Knowing how to walk Vorago is useful for moving him on phase 2. First determine his walking direction. Step one tile under Vorago and immediately cast an ability to walk him one tile in his walking direction. (note: if you do not cast an ability he may walk on top of you and around to the other side) Once you determine Vorago's walking direction, it is easiest to manipulate his position from the opposite side, i.e. if Vorago is walking west, stand on the east side of him. In order to move Vorago, he must be following you. During phase 2, Vorago does not follow between the red bomb and start of bleeds. This means if you step out of melee distance expecting Vorago to follow you after the red, he will stand there until bleeds begin. However, he can be walked under which will cause him to move in the direction he is walking. If Vorago is walking south, go west and bladed dive onto the square marked with the blue blubber jellyfish To bring Vorago back to base spot when vorago is lured south during bleeds, step 2 squares north of the square west of L rock and provoke If Vorago is north, step 2 squares south instead.

These tips can range from very helpful (to the point where dps strategies rely on them) to just knowing them for the sake of trivia. These are generally organized by phase. Some of this information is already listed on the RS Wiki but for the sake of completion I will reiterate them here. This is not an extensive list of all glitches and misc. tips as I\u2019m sure there are more to be discovered. Unless stated otherwise, all of these apply to both normal mode and hard mode. \u2b25 Pre-Fight \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e \u2022 Challenge Timer \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e - Vorago\u2019s fight challenge operates on a timer of 20 seconds. If you teleport away after you\u2019ve accepted Vorago\u2019s challenge to fight, and you travel back to the Face area within the 20 seconds, Vorago will still start the encounter and bring everyone into P1. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e - Potential application: If you teleport away, do not return to the Face area within 20 seconds unless you wish to join the fight. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e \u2022 Fake Dropdown \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e - There are some methods wherein you can take the dropdown damage but not enter the fight. One method of doing so is to open the \u201cchange username\u201d interface, though you do not need to change your username \u2013 just have the interface open. The dropdown damage will still calculate as if you will join the fight (eg. In a team of five, the dropdown damage will be 10k even though only four people enter the kill). \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e - Potential application: This could be used to lessen dropdown damage without having to enter p1 and lobby thereafter, in the event you need to get someone with low HP into the fight. \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e \u2022 Rest Animation \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e - If you are in a rest animation when someone initiates the fight challenge prompt, you will not receive the challenge prompt until you have left the rest animation. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e - Potential application: Don\u2019t accidentally not accept the challenge prompt by resting at Face. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e \u2022 Lucky and Dropdown Damage \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e - The Lucky perk can proc on the dropdown damage. Defenders and Armor set effects such as the Saradomin Warpriest effect can also proc on the dropdown damage nulling it to 1. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e - Potential applications: Get lucky and take 1 damage instead of 12500. This is unlikely to be useful for regular kills however. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e \u2022 Powerburst of vitality \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e - Dropdown is 20 seconds after challenge, so you can time using the powerburst of vitality by using a defensive ability like Preparation. Then right when it has some time before it comes back, you can use the powerburst right then to start the fight with more health than if you just used a phoenix necklace. You can also bring only one dose if you don't need it for the rest of the kill so you can equip your 2h weapons without needing to eat something else. \u2b25 Phase 1 \u2022 Less Bombs on P1 \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e - Once the TL5 reaches the top rock and vokes Vorago, Vorago will throw less auto attacks and often have a longer delay between auto attacks, provided no one else is standing in MD (ie. Base should not voke and stand MD until around 30k hp). \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e - Potential application: In trios, this lessens the number of blues and red bombs the Bomb Tank has to take during P1 \u2022 TL5 Corner and Attack Range \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e - Assuming the Base lures Vorago to the North West quadrant so that the TL5 takes bombs as he climbs to the voke spot, the far North West corner of the TL5 path is often too far away from Vorago\u2019s attack range. Thus, if the TL5 spends too long in the corner of the North West section, Vorago will start throwing bombs to the next furthest person which is usually the Bomb Tank. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e - Potential application: The TL5 should run past the North West corner as fast as possible to avoid sending bombs to the Bomb Tank in trios. \u200e\u2022 How to Lobby P1 \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e - If the TL5 is standing on the top platform and vokes Vorago, the rest of the team can run to the South wall and exit combat to lobby. Vorago may throw occasionally throw blue bombs to the people running Southward, though, he will do it so infrequently that you should still be able to lobby in between blue bombs. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e - Potential application: Lobby p1 if someone dies and you don\u2019t want to invest more to further the kill. \u2022 Jump Damage Null \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e - Upon the TL5 clicking to jump on Vorago, all incoming damage will be nulled on the tick when the TL5 clicks to jump. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e - Potential application: If Vorago is close to HP reset and the TL5 sees someone doing a wild magic that will reset the HP, the TL5 can click to jump and immediately null any incoming damage, preventing an HP reset. \u2022 TL5 Staying in Combat \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e - The jump animation is exactly 17 seconds. As the TL5, it is possible to stay in combat during the jump animation. This requires the TL5 to do an ability on the tick you click to jump. If you do an ability and wait a couple ticks before jump, you will have exited combat and lost adren during the jump animation. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e - Potential application: This is a way for the TL5 to keep adren during jump and threshold after jump to end p1 faster. \u200e\u2022 Movement after Jump \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e - If the Base moves away from MD during the jump animation, Vorago will follow the Base as if Vorago is still in MD. However, Vorago will not visibly move as he is stuck in the jump animation. After the jump animation is over and the TL5 reaches the ground, Vorago\u2019s character will \u201cteleport\u201d to be MD of where-ever the Base has walked to. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e - Potential application: In duos, the Base can escape during the jump animation. If the Bomb/TL5 happens to have a red bomb on them, the red bomb won\u2019t deal 3k damage as the Base is far enough away. Be sure to walk one step north after you\u2019ve escaped to prevent Vorago from moonwalking around the Base. \u2022 Movement after Jump part 2 \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e - After Vorago has moved to the Base\u2019s MD post-jump, Vorago will not move from that location unless the Base steps under him. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e - Potential application: If no one is standing MD, Vorago will continue to throw blue bombs to the Bomb Tank. The Base can step away from Vorago\u2019s MD and devo-cept the Bomb Tank. \u2022 1 HP Glitch \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e - Vorago will regenerate HP on phase 1 at 1:09 (also 2:09, 3:09, etc.), if Vorago regenerates HP while jumping around before the phase transition, Vorago can have random aggro at the start of p2 meaning the first bleed on p2 will also be to a random person. Vorago can also start throwing blues and potentially reds. The blue and red bombs can follow you through the phase transition damage you upon p2 dropdown. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e - Potential applications: The Base should target cycle as soon as possible on p2 to ensure that Base has aggro on p2. \u2b25 Phase 2 \u2022 Invisible First Bleed \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e - The first bleed of P2 does not have a character animation as Vorago is still in his dropdown animation. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e - Potential application: Clear the first bleed by using freedom first, then tag and voke if you are the Base. \u2022 1 Tick Bleed Clear \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e - It is possible to clear the bleed in 1 tick by first escaping, then bladed diving back onto Vorago within the same tick. You must target Vorago with the bladed dive, targeting the ground for MD will not work and will make Vorago walk towards you. You must avoid standing on the corner of Vorago\u2019s MD as this will also make Vorago walk toward you after you\u2019ve escaped. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e - Potential application: This is another way to keep Vorago in Base spot while clearing bleeds without freedom. \u2022 Instant Bleed Clear \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e - After a bleed is applied, there is a couple ticks delay between when the bleed is applied to when the dismember icon appears on the debuff bar. It is possible to clear a bleed before the dismember bleed icon appears on your debuff bar. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e - Potential application: You can clear bleeds faster than you think. \u2022 . Voke Splash \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e - It is possible to have a voke splash on P2, and (likely) all other phases of the boss too. If a player vokes Vorago and another player is standing within the path of Vorago and the voker, Vorago will aggro onto the person standing in-between instead. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e - Potential applications: Avoid voking Vorago while standing behind another player. See clip: https://clips.twitch.tv/FrigidDeafMooseThisIsSparta \u200e\u2022 Clearing All Bleeds Solo \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e - It is possible to clear all five bleeds solo. The order is escape/surge, bladed dive, freedom, escape/surge, bladed dive. Note a mobile perk is needed. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e - Potential application: Clear all five bleeds solo in case of dead teammates. \u2022 2k Typeless Damage \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e - Sometimes, after Bring Him Down, all players in the arena will take a 2k typeless hit immediately after the spam click mechanic. It is unclear what triggers this though it is believe to be an \u201canti-afk\u201d where if players ignore Vorago for too long, Vorago will perform the 2k typeless hit (similar to how you must stay in combat in Yaka). This 2k typeless hit can also be encountered during P1 if the TL5 vokes Vorago and everyone else lobbies, but the TL5 stays in the kill and exits combat. The TL5 will proceed to take 2k typeless hits. It seems the entire team must exit combat for this bleed to occur, though confirmation on this is needed. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e - Potential applications: Keep above 2k HP after Bring Him Down just in case. \u2022 Stuck Under Vorago \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e - During Bring Him Down, it is possible to get stuck under Vorago after the spam click mechanic. This is usually triggered by standing under Vorago during the Bring Him Down mechanic. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e - Potential applications: Avoid standing under Vorago during Bring Him Down. \u200e\u2022 Bring Him Down \u2013 DPS Check \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e - The Bring Him Down DPS check to make Vorago stumble is 50k Hp no matter the team size. This is rather trivial to do in a team size of 3+ but becomes harder in Duos. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e - Potential applications: Do approx. 50k worth of damage during Bring Him Down to get past the mechanic. \u2022 Bring Him Down \u2013 Staying in Combat \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e - Occasionally, it is possible to exit combat and drop adren during the Bring Him Down spam click mechanic. This usually occurs when players have refreshed their combat state before the last Gravity Orb is tagged. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e - Potential applications: To avoid dropping combat and losing adren during Bring Him Down, do a defensive ability during the spam click mechanic, such as anticipate. \u2b25 Phase 3 \u2022 Scopulus \u2013 Aggro \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e - The Scopulus aggro seem to be random though there are a couple ways to trigger a reaggro. 1) If a player is constantly in motion, the Scopulus tend to aggro them more. 2) A player with an Ice Nihil will tend to draw more aggro, due to the Ice Nihil\u2019s special effect acting on the Scops. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e - Potential applications: Bring a Smoke Nihil on Scop rotations to avoid drawing aggro. \u2022 Vitalis \u2013 Base Spot and Vitalis Spawn \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e - If Vorago is not moved from the initial dropdown spot, the Vitalis Orb will always be sent North, North East, or East. If Vorago is moved from the initial dropdown spot, the Vitalis Orb can be send in any direction. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e - Potential application: Avoid moving Vorago to have a predictable Vitalis Orb spawn. \u200e\u2022 Vitalis \u2013 Max Vitalis \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e - The maximum number of Vitalis that can fill the room in Normal Mode is 15, the max in Hard Mode is 25. In Normal Mode, the number of Vitalis spawning per Orb is 5 on p3 and p4, and 2-4 on p5. In Hard Mode, there are 7 Vitalis on p5 and p9, and between 3 to 5 on p10 and p11. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e - Potential applications: If you want to block all Vitalis spawns, have the appropriate number of people standing in the spawn Orb. \u2022 Vitalis \u2013 Death Animation \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e - A Vitalis minion is still treated as a physical object while in its death animation. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e - Potential application: If surrounded by Vitali, be vary of their death animations still counting as a physical object. Same applies to Waterfall on P4, your character will attempt to path around the dying Vitalis which may lead to exiting the waterfall prematurely. See clip: https://youtu.be/-HOB3kLpHgI \u200e\u2022 Teamsplit \u2013 Auto Attacks \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e - During the teamsplit mechanic, if you attempt to cast an auto attack on Vorago while outside the max cast distance, your character will run into the max cast distance in an attempt to cast your spell. Often times this results in a player leaving the teamsplit box early and taking 8k damage. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e - Potential application: Do not attempt to auto cast while in teamsplit unless you are certain you are within 7 squares to Vorago. \u2022 Teamsplit \u2013 Hard Mode \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e - The teamsplit boxes in hardmode, although appearing to be only 1x1, are actually 1x2. The square directly east of the 1x1 square is also safe to stand on. The same applies to the teamsplit boxes on p10 and p11. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e - Potential application: Another safe square to stand on for team split. \u2022 The End \u2013 Glitch out of Arms \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e - It is possible to glitch out of the arms during the mechanic by standing directly on the South line, or East line, in the respective quadrants. When Vorago\u2019s arm crosses said line, your character is free to move out into the open arena. Note that if you do not move after \u201cglitching out\u201d and stay standing on the South or East line, you will be forced back into the arms mechanic. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e - Potential applications: DPS can glitch out of arms and set up their Sun with ample space. \u2022 The End \u2013 Bombs after Phase \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e - Vorago only allows bombs to be interacted with when it is pointed to in their respective quadrant. If Vorago happens to phase while looking at a specific quadrant, the bombs in that quadrant can still be activated while the phase transition is happening. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e - Potential applications: Tag the red bombs during a phase transition and ask for a group hug. \u2b25 Phase 4 \u2022 Waterfall \u2013 First Spawn \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e - The first spawn of the waterfall will never be on the North East corner of the arena. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e - Potential applications: That is one less corner you have to consider for waterfall upon dropdown. \u2022 Waterfall \u2013 Auto Attacks \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e - Initiating an auto attack while standing in waterfall will force your character to run into max cast distance and often outside of the waterfall. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e - Potential applications: Avoid using auto attacks on Vorago while standing in waterfall. \u2022 Waterfall \u2013 Corners of the Waterfall \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e - The corners of the waterfall (excluding the NE, SE, NW, SW corner) are not considered part of the waterfall. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e - Potential application: Avoid standing on the edge/corners of the waterfall or else be ready to take a 9800 hit. \u200e\u2022 Stone Clone \u2013 Vorago Melee Animation \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e - Upon summoning a stone clone, Vorago will perform a melee swipe animation. This melee swipe animation is non-damaging and is only cosmetic. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e - Potential applications: Do not try to res this attack as it won\u2019t hit anything. \u2022 Stone Clone \u2013 No target \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e - If the stone clone target dies on the same tick, or shortly after the stone clone spawns, the stone clone will stand idle for a couple seconds before reaggroing to another person. However, the new player cannot attack the stone clone back as they are not the stone clones\u2019 original target. The stone clone will eventually despawn. \u2022 Teamsplit \u2013 Third Waterfall \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e - The teamsplit mechanic after the third waterfall is currently glitched. Vorago is still attackable during the teamsplit and if attacked, Vorago will proceed with his rotation and throw three blues, followed by bleeds. This means the team will have to tank 3 blues without any defensives and be ready to immediately deal with bleeds out of team split. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e - Potential applications: DO NOT ATTACK Vorago as teamsplit is about to spawn. This prevents Vorago from sending blues during the teamsplit. \u2b25 Phase 5 \u2022 Walking MD \u2013 Revo Friendly \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e - A player can spam click the ground behind Vorago to make their character stand MD while also stopping revo from attacking. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e - Potential application: Good for revo users to MD and be ready to clear bleeds on tick. \u2022 P5 Voke \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e - Due to how P5 is set up, a player cannot voke Vorago during p5. The ability will simply not activate when pressed. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e - Potential application: None. \u2022 Melee Dismember on Reflects \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e - If a player applies the dismember melee ability on reflects to another player, and the victim player receives the first bleed, the first bleed damage will immediately apply the 4500 damage as if the player was taking a second bleed from Vorago without clearing the first bleed. This is most likely an oversight. It is unknown if this works on p2, p3, and p4. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e - Potential applications: Prank your teammates by putting a dismember on them during reflects. \u200e\u2022 Stall and Auto Attacks \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Vorago begins his attack pattern the tick after the target cycle tick. His attack speed varies: \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- His attack speed will be 4 ticks if the last action he performed was either being pushed forwards or being pushed back \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- His attack speed will be 3 ticks if the last action he performed was attacking, whether it be a special attack, blue bomb, or melee swipe. This includes if he pushes and attacks in the same tick. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- As you can attack Vorago on the target cycle tick, which is before he releases the first spec, you can delay the release of the first special attack. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Potential applications: 0-Linking green bomb/vitalis; 0-Specing \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Vorago can only be pushed once in either direction on any given tick. \u200e\u2022 Damaged Required to Push \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Pushing Vorago one tile entails dealing 20k damage to him. As soon as this 20k threshold is hit, the damage counter resets to 0 for the next tile. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- For example, if you deal one hit of damage that deals 30k damage to Vorago, 30k damage is added to the damage counter, then the game performs a check to see if that total value is at least 20k. It finds that 30,000 >= 20,000 holds true, so Vorago pushes a tile and then the counter is reset to 0, effectively losing 10,000 damage. This 10,000 damage is referred to as \u201coverkill\u201d. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- As an alternative example, presume you deal three individual hits of 10,000 damage on the same tick. The first one is added to the damage counter, it checks if 10,000 >= 20,000 and finds that is false, so that hit doesn\u2019t cause it to push. The next hit is then added to the damage counter, which is now at 20,000 damage. It checks if 20,000 >= 20,000 and finds that is true, so the boss pushes and resets the damage counter to 0. Finally, the last hit of 10,000 is added to the damage counter, and it performs the same check, but finds that 10,000 >= 20,000 does not hold true. This 10,000 damage stays in the damage counter until the next tick, and this damage is referred to as \u201coverflow\u201d. So the result of these hits is pushing one tile with 10,000 overflow. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- As a final example, suppose there is one last hit of 10,000 damage on that tick. Again, this 10,000 is added to the damage counter as before, for a total of 20,000 damage. The game performs the same check and finds that 20,000 is in fact at least 20,000, so the damage counter resets. Vorago cannot be pushed twice on the same tick, so hitting this 40,000 damage mark in one tick may actively be detrimental to a kill, as you will end up losing 20,000 damage.","title":"Miscellaneous Vorago Mechanics, Interactions and Glitches (Credit to \u0002amp\u0003#64;\u0002amp\u0003#50;\u0002amp\u0003#49;\u0002amp\u0003#54;\u0002amp\u0003#52;\u0002amp\u0003#51;\u0002amp\u0003#51;\u0002amp\u0003#55;\u0002amp\u0003#48;\u0002amp\u0003#54;\u0002amp\u0003#51;\u0002amp\u0003#52;\u0002amp\u0003#51;\u0002amp\u0003#50;\u0002amp\u0003#48;\u0002amp\u0003#50;\u0002amp\u0003#56;\u0002amp\u0003#49;\u0002amp\u0003#54;)"},{"location":"pvme-guides/high-tier-pvm/vorago-tips-and-tricks/#lure-to-tl5-spot-in-small-teams-credit-to-amp64amp51amp55amp51amp56amp52amp52amp57amp48amp49amp50amp55amp51amp55amp57amp54amp54amp48amp56httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvomyo-xwpxjofeatureyoutube","text":"","title":"Lure to TL5 spot in small teams (Credit to \u0002amp\u0003#64;\u0002amp\u0003#51;\u0002amp\u0003#55;\u0002amp\u0003#51;\u0002amp\u0003#56;\u0002amp\u0003#52;\u0002amp\u0003#52;\u0002amp\u0003#57;\u0002amp\u0003#48;\u0002amp\u0003#49;\u0002amp\u0003#50;\u0002amp\u0003#55;\u0002amp\u0003#51;\u0002amp\u0003#55;\u0002amp\u0003#57;\u0002amp\u0003#54;\u0002amp\u0003#54;\u0002amp\u0003#48;\u0002amp\u0003#56;)https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmYO-xwpxjo&amp;feature=youtu.be"},{"location":"pvme-guides/high-tier-pvm/vorago-tips-and-tricks/#proper-climbing-as-tl5-credit-to-amp64amp51amp55amp51amp56amp52amp52amp57amp48amp49amp50amp55amp51amp55amp57amp54amp54amp48amp56httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvmzyfjey6iwqfeatureyoutube","text":"","title":"Proper climbing as TL5 (Credit to \u0002amp\u0003#64;\u0002amp\u0003#51;\u0002amp\u0003#55;\u0002amp\u0003#51;\u0002amp\u0003#56;\u0002amp\u0003#52;\u0002amp\u0003#52;\u0002amp\u0003#57;\u0002amp\u0003#48;\u0002amp\u0003#49;\u0002amp\u0003#50;\u0002amp\u0003#55;\u0002amp\u0003#51;\u0002amp\u0003#55;\u0002amp\u0003#57;\u0002amp\u0003#54;\u0002amp\u0003#54;\u0002amp\u0003#48;\u0002amp\u0003#56;)https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mzyfjey6IwQ&amp;feature=youtu.be"},{"location":"pvme-guides/high-tier-pvm/vorago-tips-and-tricks/#how-to-tick-shatter-on-p2-credit-to-amp64amp51amp55amp51amp56amp52amp52amp57amp48amp49amp50amp55amp51amp55amp57amp54amp54amp48amp56httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvcxqnt7xoohkfeatureyoutube","text":"","title":"How to tick shatter on P2 (Credit to \u0002amp\u0003#64;\u0002amp\u0003#51;\u0002amp\u0003#55;\u0002amp\u0003#51;\u0002amp\u0003#56;\u0002amp\u0003#52;\u0002amp\u0003#52;\u0002amp\u0003#57;\u0002amp\u0003#48;\u0002amp\u0003#49;\u0002amp\u0003#50;\u0002amp\u0003#55;\u0002amp\u0003#51;\u0002amp\u0003#55;\u0002amp\u0003#57;\u0002amp\u0003#54;\u0002amp\u0003#54;\u0002amp\u0003#48;\u0002amp\u0003#56;)https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXqNT7XOOHk&amp;feature=youtu.be"},{"location":"pvme-guides/high-tier-pvm/vorago-tips-and-tricks/#stalling-wild-magic-as-top-lure-credit-to-amp64amp49amp56amp53amp51amp49amp53amp53amp50amp55amp53amp55amp49amp52amp48amp54amp56amp52amp56httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvsgnthnno9w8featureyoutube","text":"","title":"Stalling Wild Magic as Top Lure (Credit to \u0002amp\u0003#64;\u0002amp\u0003#49;\u0002amp\u0003#56;\u0002amp\u0003#53;\u0002amp\u0003#51;\u0002amp\u0003#49;\u0002amp\u0003#53;\u0002amp\u0003#53;\u0002amp\u0003#50;\u0002amp\u0003#55;\u0002amp\u0003#53;\u0002amp\u0003#55;\u0002amp\u0003#49;\u0002amp\u0003#52;\u0002amp\u0003#48;\u0002amp\u0003#54;\u0002amp\u0003#56;\u0002amp\u0003#52;\u0002amp\u0003#56;)https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgnThNnO9W8&amp;feature=youtu.be"},{"location":"pvme-guides/high-tier-pvm/vorago-tips-and-tricks/#vorago-crack-healing","text":"During a phase transition at Vorago, your character is immune for 1 tick. You can take advantage of this by using the spell Heal Other from the Lunar Spellbook and cast the heal at the same time as a phase transition. Normally, Heal Other will take hp from your character and transfer it to your target player; this results in a large 3-7k typeless \"hit\" on your character that is unavoidable. However, as your character is immune during a phase transition, the Heal Other will not damage your character. Thus, your target player will gain hp at no cost to you. This works on any phase transition at Vorago in both normal mode and hard mode (with the exception of p10 -> p11 at hard mode). How to perform a crack heal: 1) Be on the Lunar Spellbook and select the spell Heal Other 2) Click your target player when the floor shows cracks, right before it collapses Note: Your target player must have Accept Aid turned ON in their settings. Note: if you mess up and perform the Heal Other too early/late, the spell will take hp from your character and transfer it to your target. Note: Heal Group can be used as well, though it requires your target player(s) to be within 1 square of you. Easiest way to achieve this is to ask your partner to follow you, or vice versa.

This is most notable on the TeamSplit rotation because the person who suns relies heavily on stall to use their threshes before TeamSplit. While this is not as harmful on other rotations, it may still prevent players from using the full duration of their sunshine. The dps of two or three players is typically greater than Vorago's push back. Thus, it is better to skip debilitate in favor of higher damage abilities to both induce stall from taking damage and dealing more damage overall. 1st blue sent out 2nd blue sent out 1st blue hits and creates stall 2nd blue hits and creates stall 3rd blue sent out Teamsplit 3rd blue hits and creates stall (while he is no longer attackable) In the above scenario Vorago pushes back 3 times and you can only take advantage of 2 times he stalls, 2 of which are 3 ticks apart. Now lets look at what Debilitating does. 1st blue sent out 2nd blue sent out 1st blue hits 3rd blue sent out 2nd blue hits and creates stall Teamsplit 3rd blue hits and creates stall (while he is no longer attackable) Debilitating prevents the first blue from stalling vorago which means that the third blue gets sent out, allowing his teamsplit attack to happen much earlier If you have disruption shield, it is best to use it on the second blue and to asphyxiate instead of debilitating. If you push Vorago after he sends out the third blue, you have a chance to take advantage of the stall from the last blue rather than getting pushed while he TeamSplits.

This is beneficial during phase 4, as it can speed up the phase. However, this is harmful on phases 3 and 5, as it gives you less time to attack the boss. When the teamsplit is broken, Vorago can still use both melee attacks and blue bombs, so keep in mind to eat up if necessary to not die to this. To break the teamsplit, you need to use mutated barge and then apply one of your melee channeled abilities as a bleed directly before the teamsplit. It does not matter which ability you use (flurry, assault, or destroy), however the tick that you apply the bleed on DOES effect how quickly the teamsplit is broken. Some ticks result in attacks starting slower during the teamsplit, meaning the phases lasts longer, where others result in the attacks starting sooner in teamsplit, meaning the phase doesn\u2019t last as long. \u200e \u200eA consistent way break the teamsplit on a fast tick is to barge immediately after the 6th blue bomb is released after the clone and then bleed destroy exactly one global cooldown later. Keep in mind to stop attacking before your barge to get the buff. If done correctly, bleeds will come immediately after a phase 4 teamsplit. The first bleed received is somewhat invisible, similar to the first bleed on phase 2, so make sure to watch out for that. In addition, you can sometimes lose aggro, so make sure to voke. Both barge and the bleed following can splash and you will still break the teamsplit.

It allows you to attack both scopulus on spawn, luring them extremely easily without issue. It can also let you attack Vorago before he becomes immune to a dropdown special attack, like the first waterfall, TeamSplit, or Purple Bomb. On the final phase, you can push forward Vorago before he does a dropdown special attack, which creates push stall, allowing you to do an additional ability. In order to target cycle Vorago on tick properly, you must know 2 important timings. Timing 1 : Phase Transition 'Crack' This timing is very easy, as the crack animation is 3 ticks long, and you just need to use movement ability like Surge, Escape, or Bladed Dive on the third tick. Alternatively, you can use Provoke on a training dummy/Vitalis, or learn the timing with any other ability such as anticipate, although the easiest and most beneficial one is to use Escape, as that let's you easily cast Heal Other while staying in range of your partner. The first tick is when the crack first appears, and the third tick is when you use surge. To help, set a metronome to 100 bpm, count to 2 when the crack appears, then use surge. Once you get the timing down in your head it is hard to mess up during the kill. Timing 2 : Mobile Cooldown Cooldowns go around 360 degrees on your abilities clockwise, and keeping clocks in mind, we can use this to help make learning the target cycle timing much easier. 9 seconds after your surge/escape with mobile perk, your ability will be at 10 o' clock on 1 tick and 11 o'clock on another tick. On 11 o'clock you need to press target cycling and an instant hitting ability to follow (like dragon breath) (See image below) Centering Vorago @!414995552393232394 and @175995416955977728 Knowing how to walk Vorago is useful for moving him on phase 2. First determine his walking direction. Step one tile under Vorago and immediately cast an ability to walk him one tile in his walking direction. (note: if you do not cast an ability he may walk on top of you and around to the other side) Once you determine Vorago's walking direction, it is easiest to manipulate his position from the opposite side, i.e. if Vorago is walking west, stand on the east side of him. In order to move Vorago, he must be following you. During phase 2, Vorago does not follow between the red bomb and start of bleeds. This means if you step out of melee distance expecting Vorago to follow you after the red, he will stand there until bleeds begin. However, he can be walked under which will cause him to move in the direction he is walking. If Vorago is walking south, go west and bladed dive onto the square marked with the blue blubber jellyfish To bring Vorago back to base spot when vorago is lured south during bleeds, step 2 squares north of the square west of L rock and provoke If Vorago is north, step 2 squares south instead.

Starting out at Vorago Vorago is relatively unique in that the smaller team you go to the boss with, the more rewarding it becomes. It's recommended to start out in a 5 man team, and gradually work down your team size, until you're able to comfortably duo vorago. It is highly recommend to use magic, as that is the meta for vorago, and has the most versatility. The inventory for vorago can vary, and the boss scales well to effort you're willing to put in. Since vorago does not take damage from familiars, the two choices are between a beast of burden (tortoise, pack yak, pack mammoth) and an accuracy boosting nihil (smoke nihil should always be used over ice, as ice can cause strange aggro issues at the boss in certain cases). As a learner, bring a beast of burden to be able to compensate for mistakes, and fill it with solid food. Once you're comfortable on a beast of burden, start taking a nihil. At the time of writing, the best place to learn Vorago is Rockman Discord (11/02/2019). Auras: As with all magic, > > The more people using dark magic, the less effective the aura. Also, the higher tier your runic accuracy, the better. Anything shown can be upgraded or downgraded as is available to you. The shield is recommended to be tier 90, and will be used for resonance initially, and barricade in more advanced strategies. For someone new to the boss, I would recommend the following inventory: The praesuls and staff are used for 4taa, and can be banked in favor of just a staff or just a wand and orb. The seismic singularity is for flanking. Jellyfish and guthix rests should be used on P3 for healing without adrenaline loss or stat drain. The wilderness sword and Excalibur are used for bladed dive, and are optional. An Excalibur should be brought for lossless healing during P3. Generally it is recommended to learn the vorago rotations in the following order (from easiest to hardest): Scopulus = TeamSplit > Ceiling Collapse > The End > Green Bomb > Vitalis Pouch: Experienced Vorago As you gain experience and require less food, it'll become easier to add more switches. Adding switches should be prioritized in the following order (Note: Switches required for 4ticking are not mentioned here, as if you are able to 4tick consistently, it is always worth doing at a boss.): \u2022 Start bringing a reaper necklace switch for p3 and p5 \u2022 Start taking runes for shield dome and intercept, to allow for more damage reduction and advanced intercept based strategies \u2022 Start taking runes for disruption shield, for further ability to mitigate damage. \u2022 Start taking a dummy for building on p3 \u2022 Start bringing a Statius Warhammer for its special attack An inventory with all of those switches incorporated would look something along these lines: Pouch Contents : Pouch 1: [This pouch is to be banked when you're able to set borrowed power to cast vulnerability] Pouch 2: Pouch 3: Pouch 4: Vorago P1 Base The base is the person tanking melee swipes. These are nothing special, just auto attacks. The only special considerations are the following: Generally, Vorago will do one at a time, a blue bomb (magic auto, covered in the bomb section), or a melee swipe (melee auto) Melee swipes are AoE in a 3x3 from the center. This means that if you could hit the base with a halberd range weapon, you will get melee swiped in addition to the base. As base, you have two options. In teams of 4 or larger Stand in the north east of the arena, roughly 5 squares west of the absolute north east corner. From here, just tank the boss with pray melee on, do damage, and resonance as needed. Once the TL5 vokes, move over to just outside of MD of vorago, and be ready to step MD and voke when the TL5 needs to jump. Ideally, voke around 35k HP, but it is worth while to voke earlier if your team is doing very good damage. In teams of 2 or 3 Stand just underneath the jump spot, slightly east of where the TL5 vokes from. Voke Vorago on drop, pray melee, and start doing damage. Build to sunshine, apot, and pump out damage with your scrimshaw and DPS prayers on. Soulsplit flick if you're comfortable doing so, and wait for TL5 to Voke. Get ready to voke back when the TL5 is prepared to jump. The main difference between these two is who will be taking bombs. In the first option, it will be the bomb tank taking bombs P1. In the second, it will be the TL5 taking bombs while climbing. Here's a good rotation for Duo+ as Base, provided by @!373844901273796608 : https://youtu.be/Iq5CcO35PH0 Bomb Mechanics As bomb, there are two mechanics to be aware of: Blue Bomb is a 7x7 AoE mage hit (center + 3) with travel time. The further you are, the longer a blue will take to hit you. You can resonance these, they're affected by devotion, and are otherwise not special. Best to pray mage when a blue is about to hit you. Blues do not splash, instead rolling half damage if a splash is decided. Red Bomb is a 5x5 AoE typless hit and scales damage based on people in an 11x11 area around you. The red bomb is capable of cancelling defensives, and can only be mitigated with barricade (which will be cancelled). Vorago can also fire a red bomb alongside a non homing blue bomb. The best way to deal with this is by stepping 3 squares away from the landing position of the blue, avoiding it, and then soul splitting through the red, as it hits through prayer regardless. Red bombs start at 2k damage, but will do more damage the more people are near you. As such, be careful with running reds into your team, since it can easily PK your team mates. Three scenarios for bomb In teams of 4 or larger You will be taking bombs P1. Do damage, be ready to prayer flick, and res blues. Remember that the reds will cancel your defensives. When you receive a red bomb message \"Vorago has sent a red bomb after you! Run!\", he is firing a non homing blue with the red bomb. This means that you can completely dodge the blue by moving squares. Since blue bombs are 3x3, this blue can be dodged simply by being outside of range of the bomb's AoE. Simply do damage and tank bombs until the end of the phase, employing resonance, devotion, or disruption shield as needed. In a team of 3 You're not taking bombs! SS your hp back up until TL5 makes it to voke spot, and then be prepared to take bombs. Employ resonance, disruption shield, and devotion as needed, and be prepared to prayer flick. In a team of 2 Follow the steps listed for TL5, as you're climbing now. TL5 As TL5, your job is to get to voke spot as quickly as possible. The faster your climb, the better the phase will go for the whole team. Drop down in TL5 spot, eat up, excalibur, and equip your bladed dive. Dodge the first non homing blue, and climb up the first obstacle. After this, surge the second obstacle, and climb. Bladed dive to the third obstacle, and jump. Then, stand in voke spot and voke the boss. Be ready to jump at roughly 30k HP, and wait for the base tank to voke. P1 Climb Diagram (courtesy of @216433706343202816 ): Vorago P2 On Phase 2, it is important that everyone stack storm shards at least twice every reflect. Stacking shards will make the end of P2 much quicker. Additionally, avoid resetting HP at the end of the phase, as the time gate will end after Bring Him Down, and the boss will only phase once remaining HP is reduced to 0. Vorago's HP resets at roughly 12.5k HP. Base On drop down, stand in base spot and be ready to take the first two bleeds. Freedom, tag, voke as vorago drops. Then, escape the second bleed. Vorago will fire a blue bomb at you. Resonance this or pray mage, and get back into MD after the bomb hits you (DO NOT GET IN TOO EARLY, YOU WILL HIT YOUR TEAM WITH THE BLUE). Wait for bleeds to end, and then MD voke back. The rest of the phase is rather simple, just make sure the boss does not move from base spot, take 1/2, res blues. On the 4th gravity orb, surge/dive towards the orb and tag it, and start spam clicking for Bring Him Down. Bomb Trio or larger On drop down, DD in base spot with the base and TL5. Wait for the third bleed (remember the first smash animation is invisible), and voke. Freedom 3, Escape 4. Then, stay out and do damage while handling bombs, until reflect. After reflect, the first attack vorago will do is a red bomb with a non homing blue. If you're not doing cade intercept strategies (which are strongly recommended in trio or duo), then dodge the non homing blue and proceed as normal. Tag orbs when you can, and mitigate damage as desired. Duo Since there is no TL5 in duo, the bomb takes 3 bleeds. Stand in the spot shown in the clip. Freedom 3, Escape/BD or just Escape 4, and let the base voke back for 5 as you run away from Vorago. Coordinate barricades with the base using the cade strategies described below, and tag orbs. An example of duo bleeds as bomb: https://youtu.be/o-1icC1bbGw TL5 On drop down, DD in base spot. Voke after the bomb escapes, but make sure to voke fast enough that the boss does not move. Freedom the 5th bleed, and wait for the base to voke. Move out of MD and DPS as normal, tagging orbs when you can. Phase 2 Cade Strategies Often times, it is beneficial for the team to coordinate barricades to mitigate damage on P2. By using intercept, you can essentially apply barricade to your teammates by routing all of their damage to you while barricaded. If we label each red bomb after reflect as 1, 2, and 3, then it is ideal for one person to cade 1/3, and the other person to cade 2. In this case, be 100% at the end of reflect, barricade yourself, and intercept your teammate. If the bomb tank is cading, force the red bomb onto someone else (in duo, this is done by stepping MD to Vorago so the base takes the red, and in trio or larger, this is done by moving far enough in that you're no longer furthest out, for example by moving MD), and then intercept them after cading. This will ensure that your cade is not cancelled, and neither of you take any damage. Note, this strategy requires the use of the Intercept spell on the Ancients spellbook. Weekly Specials For an explanation of the weekly specials, consult the RuneScape Wiki https://runescape.wiki/w/Vorago/Strategies#Phase_3_2 Phase 3 P3 Duo Rotations can be found in <#645460937473785886> Vorago Attack Rotations Player DPS Rotations by Week General note: for teams of 4+, the DPS will follow the same rotation as the TL5 Ceilings TL5 \u2013 Stand South of L rock. Do Asphyx, Wm, Dbreath, and Sonic then get off for reflects. The first rock will drop around the time you do Dbreath, move in closer when you do Dbreath/Sonic. Build with 1-2 defensives and charge Deto on reflects. Auto, Deto, Dbreath on release and Asphyx, Sonic. By this time the second rock will have dropped. Apot and Onslaught after you\u2019ve moved in closer. Base \u2013 Same as TL5. On reflects you can stand MD and Voke to take some melee hits and lessen the number of bombs sent to the Bomb Tank, but this is optional. Be wary of Melee AoE swipes to your TL5 if you happen to Voke and stand MD. Bomb \u2013 Stand East or West at max cast distance. Disruption Shield (optional) on dropdown and do Asphyx, Wm, Dbreath, Sonic then get off for reflects. The first rock will drop around the time you do Dbreath, avoid the rock and stay at max cast distance to Vorago after he lands. Build on reflects with some defensives and start a Res, then initiate Deto (the Res will stay active in Deto if you keep your shield equipped). Auto, Deto, Dbreath on release and Asphyx, Corrupt. By this time the second rock will have dropped, and you should stay at max cast distance again. From here you have two options: Option 1) Devotion, Apot, and Onslaught with Excal and go until 4k hp or cancel at your discretion. Use basics to finish the phase. This is the riskier but faster option. Note that the red bomb will be followed by a homing blue bomb and will hit after the red bomb has canceled your devotion, so be prepared to take a 2k red bomb plus a blue bomb. \u200e \u200e Option 2) Metamorphosis, apot, thresholds and optionally Reprisal the red bomb and blue bombs. Limitless sigil is highly recommended for this option. Use basics to finish the phase. This is the less risky option as you can eat blue blubber and Guthix rests in metamorphosis but is slower compared to option 1. Scopulus TL5 \u2013 Stand 2-3 squares West of L rock and Sun as Scops spawn. Vuln, Apot, Excal and dps down the Scops. Pray melee as Scops can hit hard, even more so when two Scops are aggro\u2019d on to you. If a Scop aggros the bomb tank, revoke ASAP. If the two Scops are positioned nicely, you can Deto as a threshold in your sun. If you are running low on food, you can devo as one scop dies to extend the devo. Phase should end as your Sun ends. Base \u2013 Same as TL5. Bomb \u2013 Stand in the South West quadrant and Sun as Scops spawn. Wait till the Base or the TL5 tag the Scop first before you tag, otherwise the Scop will aggro you. Vuln, Apot, Excal. Do a WM first and grab a Res shortly after. From here, depending on your hp and how the dps is, you can either Asphyx or Devo and continue to dps the Scops. Phase should end as your Sun ends. Vitalis (Courtesy of NoName) Everyone goes to their own corner and does a DPS rotation in MD, flicking blue bombs and melee swipes. I advise going about this by camping melee prayer until the one tick you may get hit by a blue, so you flick to magic prayer for one tick then flick back. TL5 stands northeast, Bomb Tank stands northwest, and Base stands south (one square north of L-rock). This is to reduce the chance that bomb and base are unable to escape bleeds should the phase ever get to that point. : Sun + adren pot drop. If you sigil, you can get both wild magic and asphyxiate off, but if you don't sigil you can just wild magic. Build with defensives while on reflect and charge detonate at an early enough time. Release detonate and use thresholds until death. : There are a couple ways to approach drop. Either: hammer + quake drop and build to zerk, or barge -> hammer -> destroy and build to zerk. After reflect, barge (you may not have this up if you barged on drop) -> ZGS spec and adren pot -> thresholds if you don't have trimmed masterwork and don't want to risk your health, or zerk if you are not too concerned with potential incoming damage and/or you have trimmed masterwork. Definitely zerk if you have trimmed masterwork, though. If learning the exact spots to stand on drop, base is one square north of L-rock. Base should provoke right on drop so that if people standing NW or NE mess up, they can walk under Vorago to get to the right spot and ensure they're MD. A pretty ideal P3 is a 0-bleed P3. Green Bomb TL5 \u2013 Stand South of L rock. Sun on dropdown, Apot and get off a WM and GStaff. If the first GB is on you, get ready to tank a 10k and get off as reflects will happen immediately afterwards. Brew back up to 10k Hp, build with defensives during reflect, charge Deto. Release Deto with Auto, Deto, Dbreath and continue to threshold. If the second GB is on you, get ready to tank another 10k hp. If the second GB is on the Bomb Tank, devo-cept the Bomb Tank and get ready to tank a 10k (KEEP PROTECT MAGIC ON). Continue with basics to finish the phase. \u200e \u200e Base \u2013 Stand West and Sun on dropdown, Apot and get off a WM. If the first GB is on you, get ready to tank a 10k and get off as reflects will happen immediately afterwards. If the first GB is on the Bomb Tank, pray magic and devo-cept the Bomb Tank and get ready to tank a 10k (KEEP PROTECT MAGIC ON). Brew back to 10k hp on reflects and build with defensives, grab a Res if possible and charge Deto. Release Deto and continue dpsing. If the second GB is on you, get ready to tank another 10k. Continue with basics to finish the phase. Bomb \u2013 Stand in the South West and Sun on dropdown. Apot and get off some thresholds. Keep an eye on where GB is and be ready to off for reflects when GB hits (if the GB is on you, the base will devo-cept you). Grab a Res and build with defensives on reflects, charge Deto. Release Deto and continue thresholding. Phase should be over as Sun ends. \u200e \u200e Extra notes: 1) If the phase isn\u2019t over by the third GB, reconsider if you and the team have the dps for this rotation. 2) Place your Sun on the edge of a quadrant. If the GB happen to occupy the quadrant your Sun is in, you can still stand in the other half of your Sun without taking mist damage. Teamsplit TL5 \u2013 Stand near L rock on dropdown and adren stall. Go into the first TS and WM, Dbreath, Asphyxiate, Sonic then off for reflects. Build adren with a shard and 1-2 defensives, and charge Deto. Release after the 3rd blue with Auto, Deto, Dbreath and go into the second TS. You can build with Anticipate and Freedom while in the second TS. WM, Dbreath, Apot, Onslaught out of second TS. Go until roughly 3k hp or cancel at your discretion and basics until the phase is over. Base \u2013 Same as TL5. Alternatively, you can WM, Asphyx, Dbreath, 4TAA + GStaff then off for reflects if the first TS is in a favorable spawn. During reflects you should Voke, pray melee and stand MD to lessen the number of blue bombs the Bomb Tank takes. Bomb \u2013 Stand near L rock on dropdown and adren stall. Go into the first TS and activate Disruption Shield (be sure to DS after Teamsplit spawns as Teamsplit will cancel your DS and defensives). WM, Corrupt, Asphyx, Dbreath then off for reflects. Build with a Shard, catch a Res if possible and charge Deto (the Res will stay active in Deto if you keep your shield equipped). Release Deto with Auto, Deto, Dbreath and go into the second TS. Build in the second TS with Anticipate and Freedom. From here you have two options: Option 1) WM, Corrupt, Devo, Apot and Onslaught with Excal. Cancel around 3-4k hp or at your discretion. Basics until the phase is over. This is riskier but will lead to a faster phase. Note that the red bomb will be followed by a homing blue bomb and will hit after the red bomb has canceled your devotion, so be prepared to take a 2k red bomb plus a blue bomb. Option 2) Metamorphosis, Apot, thresholds and optionally Reprisal the red bomb and blue bombs. Limitless sigil is highly recommended for this option. Use basics to finish the phase. This is the less risky option as you can eat blue blubber and Guthix rests in metamorphosis but is slower compared to option 1. Extra notes: do not attempt to cast an auto attack while standing in the TS box unless you are sure you are within max cast distance (7 squares). Otherwise, your character will attempt to run into cast distance before the TS is over, resulting in you taking an 8k hit. The End (Purple Bomb) TL5 \u2013 Stand near L rock on dropdown. Get into the quadrant Vorago points to and do Asphyx, WM, Dbreath, then Sonic as you move to the next quadrant. Glitch out of arms ASAP and Sun, apot, and build with basics till Vorago stands up. Upon stand up, pray magic, WM, Asphyx, GStaff and off for Reflects. Build with Shards and 1-2 defensives and charge Deto. Release Deto after the 3rd blue bomb with Auto, Deto, Dbreath. Enter the next quadrant and do Asphyx, WM, GStaff/Dbreath, Sonic and glitch out ASAP. If the phase is still not over at this point, gauge how much hp is left and decide on the following two options. Option 1) Below 60k Hp. Continue dpsing Vorago with basics and charge Deto in the second to last quadrant. Release with Auto, Deto, WM the second Vorago begins his stand up animation, but before Vorago throws bombs. The reason being Vorago will have 75% damage reduction in the last quadrant until he stands up, however, Vorago will go back to taking full damage slightly before his full stand up animation. Thus, you want to stack as much damage as possible before his stand up but after Vorago starts taking full damage. If done properly, Vorago will end the phase and no bombs will be sent out. Option 2) Above 60k hp. Continue dpsing Vorago with basics. On stand up, pray magic, WM, Asphyx, GStaff/Dbreath and continue dpsing. If the phase is still not over, reconsider if you and the team have the dps for this rotation. Base \u2013 Same as TL5. In option 2, you should stay inside the quadrants and devo-cept the Bomb Tank as he tags blue bombs. On stand up do thresholds and finish the phase. During reflects you can Voke and stand MD but it is optional. Be wary of melee AoEs hitting your TL5 if you stand MD. Bomb \u2013 Stand near L rock on dropdown. Get into the quadrant Vorago points to and do Asphyx, WM, Dbreath, then Sonic as you move to the next quadrant. Stay inside the quadrants and in the second to last quadrant place your Sun at max cast distance and continue to build with basics and drink your Apot. As the last quadrant opens up, tag the purple bomb early and get back to your Sun. Upon stand up, pray magic, WM, Asphyx, GStaff and off for Reflects. Build with Shards, catch a Res if possible, and charge Deto. Release Deto after the 3rd blue bomb with Auto, Deto, Dbreath. At this point, the hp should be low enough to finish the phase without going through a second set of stand-up bombs. If not, enter the next quadrant and do Asphyx, WM, GStaff/Dbreath, Sonic. If the phase is still not over at this point, gauge how much hp is left and decide on the following two options. Option 1) Below 60k Hp. Continue dpsing Vorago with basics and charge Deto in the second to last quadrant. Release with Auto, Deto, WM the second Vorago begins his stand up animation, but before Vorago throws bombs. The reason being Vorago will have 75% damage reduction in the last quadrant until he stands up, however, Vorago will go back to taking full damage slightly before his full stand up animation. Thus, you want to stack as much damage as possible before his stand up but after Vorago starts taking full damage. If done properly, Vorago will end the phase and no bombs will be sent out. Option 2) Above 60k hp. Continue dpsing Vorago with basics and stay inside the quadrants. Tag the blue bombs and have the Base devo-cept you. On stand up, pray magic, WM, Asphyx, GStaff/Dbreath and continue dpsing, watching out for the incoming red bomb. If the phase is still not over, reconsider if you and the team have the dps for this rotation. The End video, bomb tank perspective: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uNQyVicWNE P4 (Waterfall) Weekly Breakdown Note: In larger teams, the base and the bomb should follow these steps to ensure minimal damage taken, and any other team members are free DPS. Phase 4 Attack Rotation Waterfall and Stone Clone Disruption Shield after waterfall starts. Base should voke Vorago, to attempt to force the stone clone onto the Bomb. Bomb should disrupt 1st blue, res 2nd, prep 3rd, and damage their stone clone. Devotion the next blue bomb on-tick and kill the clone. Guthix Staff spec and both players should use Storm Shard on Vorago. From here the strategy is different for each week, but the focus is mitigating damage as much as possible. Ceiling Collapse Bomb tank cade cepts the base. Both focus on clearing rocks. Do bleeds + reflect as usual. Scopulus Base tank cade cepts the bomb on red bomb launch. Do bleeds + reflect as usual. Vitalis Both base and bomb tank should go north-east. Bomb tank cade cepts base. Focus on clearing Vitalis. Do bleeds + reflect as usual. Green Bomb Wait for green bomb launch. Person without a green bomb cade cepts the other person. Do bleeds + reflect as usual. Teamsplit Go into your colored box. Base immediately barges MD. Do bleeds + reflect as usual. The End Base tag reds, bomb cade cepts. On standup, base cade cepts bomb, then devo cepts on red bomb launch while standing outside of MD. Go back in MD on reflect. Final reflect and waterfall Before the 2nd reflect starts, Vorago should be around 20k HP or less. Do not reset the HP at this point. After the last waterfall, use Shatter and other basics/thresholds until Vorago is phased. Bomb tank should pick up the final maul piece and make the maul. Phase 5 Note: These are written for duos, but in larger teams, this is still ideal to follow, with the TL5 and extra members being free DPS. The only exception is on P5 for The End (Purple Bomb) and Scopulus, onslaught is no longer viable as team members will have to run purple bombs in teams of 4 or larger. For Duo P5 look in <#645460937473785886> Phase 5 Attack Rotation Clearing bleeds This is the most important part of ensuring a kill, as one person is guaranteed to get at least 2 bleeds, often times 3. The most straightforward way is to bladed dive out as you receive the first bleed. Turn walk on to ensure you stay in max distance, then surge back in on the second bleed. Freedom if you receive a third bleed. This ensures no ticks are lost when clearing bleeds and will always guarantee bleeds to be cleared. Other methods include Freedom/Escape/Barge, Escape/Freedom/Barge, Escape/Barge/Bladed Dive, etc. As long as you are able to move at least 6 squares from your current positions, you will always be able to clear every bleed. Ceiling Collapse/Teamsplit Base sun drop and Limitless + Wild Magic + Asphyx. Bomb disruption shield after TS, Wild Magic + Corruption + Combust out of TS, and cade on first blue. Bomb intercepts base on reflect and both go MD. Vuln and build with shard/defensives. Clear bleeds with bladed dive/surge/freedom. Bomb suns while base debilitates on first blue. Reprisal TS, bomb use thresholds under sun and base disrupts + cades on blues out of TS. Repeat until maul. DO NOT use Onslaught on this week! Do not Barricade after bleeds either, unless you are 1 off. DPS should Sunshine and do as much damage pre-reflect as possible, then do thresholds during sun again during bleeds. If you own Reprisal, tank the teamsplit with it. Otherwise, go in and then exit with a threshold. Scopulus/The End Base stand 2 squares away from MD with disruption shield active. Bomb stand MD and detonate + wild magic on drop with disruption shield active. Let 1st bomb go on base, then bomb clears next bomb with disrupt, cade on 3rd bomb. Both go MD with intercept, vuln and build. Clear bleeds with bladed dive/surge/freedom. Bomb should start onslaught, base should disrupt 1st blue and cade on 2nd blue. Should be maul, if not then use sunshines/onslaughts until maul. DPS will have to run purple bombs in teams of 4 or larger. To do this, simply have DPS stay south, then run north when your detonation timer reaches 5 or less, then run back after your bomb explodes. In smaller teams, you may Onslaught drop. Be wary of your positioning, however. Typically, one teammate stands north and one south. This way, you may maximize use of Onslaught without worrying about any other factors of damage. Vitalis Base sun drop and Limitless + Asphyx + Wild Magic. Bomb disruption shield and cade cept Vitalis orbs early. If any Vitalis appear, clear them ASAP (1-2 may spawn). On reflect have one person go MD. Clear bleeds as usual, then base debilitate blues after bleeds while bomb sunshines. Repeat until maul. If close enough to maul spot, you can barricade and onslaught instead. DPS should Sunshine drop and make sure to step back to block the Vitalis orb explosion. If any Vitalis spawn, defeat them and keep targeting the Vit until they are dead. You can also place Dominion mines to instantly deal 8k damage to any spawned Vits. Green Bomb Both players Asphyx drop. Person with green bomb steps in and use sun, other person cade cepts. Do as much damage as you can until reflect. Vuln on reflect, but do not step in. Clear bleeds as usual, person who used cade should sun after bleeds, other person debilitate blues. If the green bomb goes on the person who used cade already: Simply cade cept the person with green bomb. Do as much damage until reflect, repeat until maul. If you\u2019re close to maul spot you can Onslaught until maul. If the green bomb goes on the person who didn\u2019t use cade: You will be in your sun, so don\u2019t use too much adren and Devotion + Intercept the person with green bomb. Be prepared to tank a 9.5k hit. Other person will cade cept and both should go MD. Repeat until maul. If you\u2019re close to maul spot you can Onslaught until maul. On larger teams, it is viable to simply pass the green bomb among DPS in the south. Simply Sunshine drop and do as much damage as possible pre-reflect. If the green bomb is on the bomb tank, bridge it from them by standing within two squares of them, then run it into the DPS pile. The green bomb only hits 3 times on this phase, but be wary because you may still take large damage if you are targeted by a green bomb twice. Learning Vorago If you're interested in learning Vorago, check out our partners at Rockman Discord by clicking the following link! Check out the role information and teaching events channels there to get started! https://discord.gg/Xr6mpyT","title":"Vorago"},{"location":"pvme-guides/high-tier-pvm/vorago/#vorago","text":"Vorago Sources All of the information regarding P3, P4, and P5 was taken from Dhoggo and Noname's guides. Starting out at Vorago Vorago is relatively unique in that the smaller team you go to the boss with, the more rewarding it becomes. It's recommended to start out in a 5 man team, and gradually work down your team size, until you're able to comfortably duo vorago. It is highly recommend to use magic, as that is the meta for vorago, and has the most versatility. The inventory for vorago can vary, and the boss scales well to effort you're willing to put in. Since vorago does not take damage from familiars, the two choices are between a beast of burden (tortoise, pack yak, pack mammoth) and an accuracy boosting nihil (smoke nihil should always be used over ice, as ice can cause strange aggro issues at the boss in certain cases). As a learner, bring a beast of burden to be able to compensate for mistakes, and fill it with solid food. Once you're comfortable on a beast of burden, start taking a nihil. At the time of writing, the best place to learn Vorago is Rockman Discord (11/02/2019). Auras: As with all magic, > > The more people using dark magic, the less effective the aura. Also, the higher tier your runic accuracy, the better. Anything shown can be upgraded or downgraded as is available to you. The shield is recommended to be tier 90, and will be used for resonance initially, and barricade in more advanced strategies. For someone new to the boss, I would recommend the following inventory: The praesuls and staff are used for 4taa, and can be banked in favor of just a staff or just a wand and orb. The seismic singularity is for flanking. Jellyfish and guthix rests should be used on P3 for healing without adrenaline loss or stat drain. The wilderness sword and Excalibur are used for bladed dive, and are optional. An Excalibur should be brought for lossless healing during P3. Generally it is recommended to learn the vorago rotations in the following order (from easiest to hardest): Scopulus = TeamSplit > Ceiling Collapse > The End > Green Bomb > Vitalis Pouch: Experienced Vorago As you gain experience and require less food, it'll become easier to add more switches. Adding switches should be prioritized in the following order (Note: Switches required for 4ticking are not mentioned here, as if you are able to 4tick consistently, it is always worth doing at a boss.): \u2022 Start bringing a reaper necklace switch for p3 and p5 \u2022 Start taking runes for shield dome and intercept, to allow for more damage reduction and advanced intercept based strategies \u2022 Start taking runes for disruption shield, for further ability to mitigate damage. \u2022 Start taking a dummy for building on p3 \u2022 Start bringing a Statius Warhammer for its special attack An inventory with all of those switches incorporated would look something along these lines: Pouch Contents : Pouch 1: [This pouch is to be banked when you're able to set borrowed power to cast vulnerability] Pouch 2: Pouch 3: Pouch 4: Vorago P1 Base The base is the person tanking melee swipes. These are nothing special, just auto attacks. The only special considerations are the following: Generally, Vorago will do one at a time, a blue bomb (magic auto, covered in the bomb section), or a melee swipe (melee auto) Melee swipes are AoE in a 3x3 from the center. This means that if you could hit the base with a halberd range weapon, you will get melee swiped in addition to the base. As base, you have two options. In teams of 4 or larger Stand in the north east of the arena, roughly 5 squares west of the absolute north east corner. From here, just tank the boss with pray melee on, do damage, and resonance as needed. Once the TL5 vokes, move over to just outside of MD of vorago, and be ready to step MD and voke when the TL5 needs to jump. Ideally, voke around 35k HP, but it is worth while to voke earlier if your team is doing very good damage. In teams of 2 or 3 Stand just underneath the jump spot, slightly east of where the TL5 vokes from. Voke Vorago on drop, pray melee, and start doing damage. Build to sunshine, apot, and pump out damage with your scrimshaw and DPS prayers on. Soulsplit flick if you're comfortable doing so, and wait for TL5 to Voke. Get ready to voke back when the TL5 is prepared to jump. The main difference between these two is who will be taking bombs. In the first option, it will be the bomb tank taking bombs P1. In the second, it will be the TL5 taking bombs while climbing. Here's a good rotation for Duo+ as Base, provided by @!373844901273796608 : https://youtu.be/Iq5CcO35PH0 Bomb Mechanics As bomb, there are two mechanics to be aware of: Blue Bomb is a 7x7 AoE mage hit (center + 3) with travel time. The further you are, the longer a blue will take to hit you. You can resonance these, they're affected by devotion, and are otherwise not special. Best to pray mage when a blue is about to hit you. Blues do not splash, instead rolling half damage if a splash is decided. Red Bomb is a 5x5 AoE typless hit and scales damage based on people in an 11x11 area around you. The red bomb is capable of cancelling defensives, and can only be mitigated with barricade (which will be cancelled). Vorago can also fire a red bomb alongside a non homing blue bomb. The best way to deal with this is by stepping 3 squares away from the landing position of the blue, avoiding it, and then soul splitting through the red, as it hits through prayer regardless. Red bombs start at 2k damage, but will do more damage the more people are near you. As such, be careful with running reds into your team, since it can easily PK your team mates. Three scenarios for bomb In teams of 4 or larger You will be taking bombs P1. Do damage, be ready to prayer flick, and res blues. Remember that the reds will cancel your defensives. When you receive a red bomb message \"Vorago has sent a red bomb after you! Run!\", he is firing a non homing blue with the red bomb. This means that you can completely dodge the blue by moving squares. Since blue bombs are 3x3, this blue can be dodged simply by being outside of range of the bomb's AoE. Simply do damage and tank bombs until the end of the phase, employing resonance, devotion, or disruption shield as needed. In a team of 3 You're not taking bombs! SS your hp back up until TL5 makes it to voke spot, and then be prepared to take bombs. Employ resonance, disruption shield, and devotion as needed, and be prepared to prayer flick. In a team of 2 Follow the steps listed for TL5, as you're climbing now. TL5 As TL5, your job is to get to voke spot as quickly as possible. The faster your climb, the better the phase will go for the whole team. Drop down in TL5 spot, eat up, excalibur, and equip your bladed dive. Dodge the first non homing blue, and climb up the first obstacle. After this, surge the second obstacle, and climb. Bladed dive to the third obstacle, and jump. Then, stand in voke spot and voke the boss. Be ready to jump at roughly 30k HP, and wait for the base tank to voke. P1 Climb Diagram (courtesy of @216433706343202816 ): Vorago P2 On Phase 2, it is important that everyone stack storm shards at least twice every reflect. Stacking shards will make the end of P2 much quicker. Additionally, avoid resetting HP at the end of the phase, as the time gate will end after Bring Him Down, and the boss will only phase once remaining HP is reduced to 0. Vorago's HP resets at roughly 12.5k HP. Base On drop down, stand in base spot and be ready to take the first two bleeds. Freedom, tag, voke as vorago drops. Then, escape the second bleed. Vorago will fire a blue bomb at you. Resonance this or pray mage, and get back into MD after the bomb hits you (DO NOT GET IN TOO EARLY, YOU WILL HIT YOUR TEAM WITH THE BLUE). Wait for bleeds to end, and then MD voke back. The rest of the phase is rather simple, just make sure the boss does not move from base spot, take 1/2, res blues. On the 4th gravity orb, surge/dive towards the orb and tag it, and start spam clicking for Bring Him Down. Bomb Trio or larger On drop down, DD in base spot with the base and TL5. Wait for the third bleed (remember the first smash animation is invisible), and voke. Freedom 3, Escape 4. Then, stay out and do damage while handling bombs, until reflect. After reflect, the first attack vorago will do is a red bomb with a non homing blue. If you're not doing cade intercept strategies (which are strongly recommended in trio or duo), then dodge the non homing blue and proceed as normal. Tag orbs when you can, and mitigate damage as desired. Duo Since there is no TL5 in duo, the bomb takes 3 bleeds. Stand in the spot shown in the clip. Freedom 3, Escape/BD or just Escape 4, and let the base voke back for 5 as you run away from Vorago. Coordinate barricades with the base using the cade strategies described below, and tag orbs. An example of duo bleeds as bomb: https://youtu.be/o-1icC1bbGw TL5 On drop down, DD in base spot. Voke after the bomb escapes, but make sure to voke fast enough that the boss does not move. Freedom the 5th bleed, and wait for the base to voke. Move out of MD and DPS as normal, tagging orbs when you can. Phase 2 Cade Strategies Often times, it is beneficial for the team to coordinate barricades to mitigate damage on P2. By using intercept, you can essentially apply barricade to your teammates by routing all of their damage to you while barricaded. If we label each red bomb after reflect as 1, 2, and 3, then it is ideal for one person to cade 1/3, and the other person to cade 2. In this case, be 100% at the end of reflect, barricade yourself, and intercept your teammate. If the bomb tank is cading, force the red bomb onto someone else (in duo, this is done by stepping MD to Vorago so the base takes the red, and in trio or larger, this is done by moving far enough in that you're no longer furthest out, for example by moving MD), and then intercept them after cading. This will ensure that your cade is not cancelled, and neither of you take any damage. Note, this strategy requires the use of the Intercept spell on the Ancients spellbook. Weekly Specials For an explanation of the weekly specials, consult the RuneScape Wiki https://runescape.wiki/w/Vorago/Strategies#Phase_3_2 Phase 3 P3 Duo Rotations can be found in <#645460937473785886> Vorago Attack Rotations Player DPS Rotations by Week General note: for teams of 4+, the DPS will follow the same rotation as the TL5 Ceilings TL5 \u2013 Stand South of L rock. Do Asphyx, Wm, Dbreath, and Sonic then get off for reflects. The first rock will drop around the time you do Dbreath, move in closer when you do Dbreath/Sonic. Build with 1-2 defensives and charge Deto on reflects. Auto, Deto, Dbreath on release and Asphyx, Sonic. By this time the second rock will have dropped. Apot and Onslaught after you\u2019ve moved in closer. Base \u2013 Same as TL5. On reflects you can stand MD and Voke to take some melee hits and lessen the number of bombs sent to the Bomb Tank, but this is optional. Be wary of Melee AoE swipes to your TL5 if you happen to Voke and stand MD. Bomb \u2013 Stand East or West at max cast distance. Disruption Shield (optional) on dropdown and do Asphyx, Wm, Dbreath, Sonic then get off for reflects. The first rock will drop around the time you do Dbreath, avoid the rock and stay at max cast distance to Vorago after he lands. Build on reflects with some defensives and start a Res, then initiate Deto (the Res will stay active in Deto if you keep your shield equipped). Auto, Deto, Dbreath on release and Asphyx, Corrupt. By this time the second rock will have dropped, and you should stay at max cast distance again. From here you have two options: Option 1) Devotion, Apot, and Onslaught with Excal and go until 4k hp or cancel at your discretion. Use basics to finish the phase. This is the riskier but faster option. Note that the red bomb will be followed by a homing blue bomb and will hit after the red bomb has canceled your devotion, so be prepared to take a 2k red bomb plus a blue bomb. \u200e \u200e Option 2) Metamorphosis, apot, thresholds and optionally Reprisal the red bomb and blue bombs. Limitless sigil is highly recommended for this option. Use basics to finish the phase. This is the less risky option as you can eat blue blubber and Guthix rests in metamorphosis but is slower compared to option 1. Scopulus TL5 \u2013 Stand 2-3 squares West of L rock and Sun as Scops spawn. Vuln, Apot, Excal and dps down the Scops. Pray melee as Scops can hit hard, even more so when two Scops are aggro\u2019d on to you. If a Scop aggros the bomb tank, revoke ASAP. If the two Scops are positioned nicely, you can Deto as a threshold in your sun. If you are running low on food, you can devo as one scop dies to extend the devo. Phase should end as your Sun ends. Base \u2013 Same as TL5. Bomb \u2013 Stand in the South West quadrant and Sun as Scops spawn. Wait till the Base or the TL5 tag the Scop first before you tag, otherwise the Scop will aggro you. Vuln, Apot, Excal. Do a WM first and grab a Res shortly after. From here, depending on your hp and how the dps is, you can either Asphyx or Devo and continue to dps the Scops. Phase should end as your Sun ends. Vitalis (Courtesy of NoName) Everyone goes to their own corner and does a DPS rotation in MD, flicking blue bombs and melee swipes. I advise going about this by camping melee prayer until the one tick you may get hit by a blue, so you flick to magic prayer for one tick then flick back. TL5 stands northeast, Bomb Tank stands northwest, and Base stands south (one square north of L-rock). This is to reduce the chance that bomb and base are unable to escape bleeds should the phase ever get to that point. : Sun + adren pot drop. If you sigil, you can get both wild magic and asphyxiate off, but if you don't sigil you can just wild magic. Build with defensives while on reflect and charge detonate at an early enough time. Release detonate and use thresholds until death. : There are a couple ways to approach drop. Either: hammer + quake drop and build to zerk, or barge -> hammer -> destroy and build to zerk. After reflect, barge (you may not have this up if you barged on drop) -> ZGS spec and adren pot -> thresholds if you don't have trimmed masterwork and don't want to risk your health, or zerk if you are not too concerned with potential incoming damage and/or you have trimmed masterwork. Definitely zerk if you have trimmed masterwork, though. If learning the exact spots to stand on drop, base is one square north of L-rock. Base should provoke right on drop so that if people standing NW or NE mess up, they can walk under Vorago to get to the right spot and ensure they're MD. A pretty ideal P3 is a 0-bleed P3. Green Bomb TL5 \u2013 Stand South of L rock. Sun on dropdown, Apot and get off a WM and GStaff. If the first GB is on you, get ready to tank a 10k and get off as reflects will happen immediately afterwards. Brew back up to 10k Hp, build with defensives during reflect, charge Deto. Release Deto with Auto, Deto, Dbreath and continue to threshold. If the second GB is on you, get ready to tank another 10k hp. If the second GB is on the Bomb Tank, devo-cept the Bomb Tank and get ready to tank a 10k (KEEP PROTECT MAGIC ON). Continue with basics to finish the phase. \u200e \u200e Base \u2013 Stand West and Sun on dropdown, Apot and get off a WM. If the first GB is on you, get ready to tank a 10k and get off as reflects will happen immediately afterwards. If the first GB is on the Bomb Tank, pray magic and devo-cept the Bomb Tank and get ready to tank a 10k (KEEP PROTECT MAGIC ON). Brew back to 10k hp on reflects and build with defensives, grab a Res if possible and charge Deto. Release Deto and continue dpsing. If the second GB is on you, get ready to tank another 10k. Continue with basics to finish the phase. Bomb \u2013 Stand in the South West and Sun on dropdown. Apot and get off some thresholds. Keep an eye on where GB is and be ready to off for reflects when GB hits (if the GB is on you, the base will devo-cept you). Grab a Res and build with defensives on reflects, charge Deto. Release Deto and continue thresholding. Phase should be over as Sun ends. \u200e \u200e Extra notes: 1) If the phase isn\u2019t over by the third GB, reconsider if you and the team have the dps for this rotation. 2) Place your Sun on the edge of a quadrant. If the GB happen to occupy the quadrant your Sun is in, you can still stand in the other half of your Sun without taking mist damage. Teamsplit TL5 \u2013 Stand near L rock on dropdown and adren stall. Go into the first TS and WM, Dbreath, Asphyxiate, Sonic then off for reflects. Build adren with a shard and 1-2 defensives, and charge Deto. Release after the 3rd blue with Auto, Deto, Dbreath and go into the second TS. You can build with Anticipate and Freedom while in the second TS. WM, Dbreath, Apot, Onslaught out of second TS. Go until roughly 3k hp or cancel at your discretion and basics until the phase is over. Base \u2013 Same as TL5. Alternatively, you can WM, Asphyx, Dbreath, 4TAA + GStaff then off for reflects if the first TS is in a favorable spawn. During reflects you should Voke, pray melee and stand MD to lessen the number of blue bombs the Bomb Tank takes. Bomb \u2013 Stand near L rock on dropdown and adren stall. Go into the first TS and activate Disruption Shield (be sure to DS after Teamsplit spawns as Teamsplit will cancel your DS and defensives). WM, Corrupt, Asphyx, Dbreath then off for reflects. Build with a Shard, catch a Res if possible and charge Deto (the Res will stay active in Deto if you keep your shield equipped). Release Deto with Auto, Deto, Dbreath and go into the second TS. Build in the second TS with Anticipate and Freedom. From here you have two options: Option 1) WM, Corrupt, Devo, Apot and Onslaught with Excal. Cancel around 3-4k hp or at your discretion. Basics until the phase is over. This is riskier but will lead to a faster phase. Note that the red bomb will be followed by a homing blue bomb and will hit after the red bomb has canceled your devotion, so be prepared to take a 2k red bomb plus a blue bomb. Option 2) Metamorphosis, Apot, thresholds and optionally Reprisal the red bomb and blue bombs. Limitless sigil is highly recommended for this option. Use basics to finish the phase. This is the less risky option as you can eat blue blubber and Guthix rests in metamorphosis but is slower compared to option 1. Extra notes: do not attempt to cast an auto attack while standing in the TS box unless you are sure you are within max cast distance (7 squares). Otherwise, your character will attempt to run into cast distance before the TS is over, resulting in you taking an 8k hit. The End (Purple Bomb) TL5 \u2013 Stand near L rock on dropdown. Get into the quadrant Vorago points to and do Asphyx, WM, Dbreath, then Sonic as you move to the next quadrant. Glitch out of arms ASAP and Sun, apot, and build with basics till Vorago stands up. Upon stand up, pray magic, WM, Asphyx, GStaff and off for Reflects. Build with Shards and 1-2 defensives and charge Deto. Release Deto after the 3rd blue bomb with Auto, Deto, Dbreath. Enter the next quadrant and do Asphyx, WM, GStaff/Dbreath, Sonic and glitch out ASAP. If the phase is still not over at this point, gauge how much hp is left and decide on the following two options. Option 1) Below 60k Hp. Continue dpsing Vorago with basics and charge Deto in the second to last quadrant. Release with Auto, Deto, WM the second Vorago begins his stand up animation, but before Vorago throws bombs. The reason being Vorago will have 75% damage reduction in the last quadrant until he stands up, however, Vorago will go back to taking full damage slightly before his full stand up animation. Thus, you want to stack as much damage as possible before his stand up but after Vorago starts taking full damage. If done properly, Vorago will end the phase and no bombs will be sent out. Option 2) Above 60k hp. Continue dpsing Vorago with basics. On stand up, pray magic, WM, Asphyx, GStaff/Dbreath and continue dpsing. If the phase is still not over, reconsider if you and the team have the dps for this rotation. Base \u2013 Same as TL5. In option 2, you should stay inside the quadrants and devo-cept the Bomb Tank as he tags blue bombs. On stand up do thresholds and finish the phase. During reflects you can Voke and stand MD but it is optional. Be wary of melee AoEs hitting your TL5 if you stand MD. Bomb \u2013 Stand near L rock on dropdown. Get into the quadrant Vorago points to and do Asphyx, WM, Dbreath, then Sonic as you move to the next quadrant. Stay inside the quadrants and in the second to last quadrant place your Sun at max cast distance and continue to build with basics and drink your Apot. As the last quadrant opens up, tag the purple bomb early and get back to your Sun. Upon stand up, pray magic, WM, Asphyx, GStaff and off for Reflects. Build with Shards, catch a Res if possible, and charge Deto. Release Deto after the 3rd blue bomb with Auto, Deto, Dbreath. At this point, the hp should be low enough to finish the phase without going through a second set of stand-up bombs. If not, enter the next quadrant and do Asphyx, WM, GStaff/Dbreath, Sonic. If the phase is still not over at this point, gauge how much hp is left and decide on the following two options. Option 1) Below 60k Hp. Continue dpsing Vorago with basics and charge Deto in the second to last quadrant. Release with Auto, Deto, WM the second Vorago begins his stand up animation, but before Vorago throws bombs. The reason being Vorago will have 75% damage reduction in the last quadrant until he stands up, however, Vorago will go back to taking full damage slightly before his full stand up animation. Thus, you want to stack as much damage as possible before his stand up but after Vorago starts taking full damage. If done properly, Vorago will end the phase and no bombs will be sent out. Option 2) Above 60k hp. Continue dpsing Vorago with basics and stay inside the quadrants. Tag the blue bombs and have the Base devo-cept you. On stand up, pray magic, WM, Asphyx, GStaff/Dbreath and continue dpsing, watching out for the incoming red bomb. If the phase is still not over, reconsider if you and the team have the dps for this rotation. The End video, bomb tank perspective: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uNQyVicWNE P4 (Waterfall) Weekly Breakdown Note: In larger teams, the base and the bomb should follow these steps to ensure minimal damage taken, and any other team members are free DPS. Phase 4 Attack Rotation Waterfall and Stone Clone Disruption Shield after waterfall starts. Base should voke Vorago, to attempt to force the stone clone onto the Bomb. Bomb should disrupt 1st blue, res 2nd, prep 3rd, and damage their stone clone. Devotion the next blue bomb on-tick and kill the clone. Guthix Staff spec and both players should use Storm Shard on Vorago. From here the strategy is different for each week, but the focus is mitigating damage as much as possible. Ceiling Collapse Bomb tank cade cepts the base. Both focus on clearing rocks. Do bleeds + reflect as usual. Scopulus Base tank cade cepts the bomb on red bomb launch. Do bleeds + reflect as usual. Vitalis Both base and bomb tank should go north-east. Bomb tank cade cepts base. Focus on clearing Vitalis. Do bleeds + reflect as usual. Green Bomb Wait for green bomb launch. Person without a green bomb cade cepts the other person. Do bleeds + reflect as usual. Teamsplit Go into your colored box. Base immediately barges MD. Do bleeds + reflect as usual. The End Base tag reds, bomb cade cepts. On standup, base cade cepts bomb, then devo cepts on red bomb launch while standing outside of MD. Go back in MD on reflect. Final reflect and waterfall Before the 2nd reflect starts, Vorago should be around 20k HP or less. Do not reset the HP at this point. After the last waterfall, use Shatter and other basics/thresholds until Vorago is phased. Bomb tank should pick up the final maul piece and make the maul. Phase 5 Note: These are written for duos, but in larger teams, this is still ideal to follow, with the TL5 and extra members being free DPS. The only exception is on P5 for The End (Purple Bomb) and Scopulus, onslaught is no longer viable as team members will have to run purple bombs in teams of 4 or larger. For Duo P5 look in <#645460937473785886> Phase 5 Attack Rotation Clearing bleeds This is the most important part of ensuring a kill, as one person is guaranteed to get at least 2 bleeds, often times 3. The most straightforward way is to bladed dive out as you receive the first bleed. Turn walk on to ensure you stay in max distance, then surge back in on the second bleed. Freedom if you receive a third bleed. This ensures no ticks are lost when clearing bleeds and will always guarantee bleeds to be cleared. Other methods include Freedom/Escape/Barge, Escape/Freedom/Barge, Escape/Barge/Bladed Dive, etc. As long as you are able to move at least 6 squares from your current positions, you will always be able to clear every bleed. Ceiling Collapse/Teamsplit Base sun drop and Limitless + Wild Magic + Asphyx. Bomb disruption shield after TS, Wild Magic + Corruption + Combust out of TS, and cade on first blue. Bomb intercepts base on reflect and both go MD. Vuln and build with shard/defensives. Clear bleeds with bladed dive/surge/freedom. Bomb suns while base debilitates on first blue. Reprisal TS, bomb use thresholds under sun and base disrupts + cades on blues out of TS. Repeat until maul. DO NOT use Onslaught on this week! Do not Barricade after bleeds either, unless you are 1 off. DPS should Sunshine and do as much damage pre-reflect as possible, then do thresholds during sun again during bleeds. If you own Reprisal, tank the teamsplit with it. Otherwise, go in and then exit with a threshold. Scopulus/The End Base stand 2 squares away from MD with disruption shield active. Bomb stand MD and detonate + wild magic on drop with disruption shield active. Let 1st bomb go on base, then bomb clears next bomb with disrupt, cade on 3rd bomb. Both go MD with intercept, vuln and build. Clear bleeds with bladed dive/surge/freedom. Bomb should start onslaught, base should disrupt 1st blue and cade on 2nd blue. Should be maul, if not then use sunshines/onslaughts until maul. DPS will have to run purple bombs in teams of 4 or larger. To do this, simply have DPS stay south, then run north when your detonation timer reaches 5 or less, then run back after your bomb explodes. In smaller teams, you may Onslaught drop. Be wary of your positioning, however. Typically, one teammate stands north and one south. This way, you may maximize use of Onslaught without worrying about any other factors of damage. Vitalis Base sun drop and Limitless + Asphyx + Wild Magic. Bomb disruption shield and cade cept Vitalis orbs early. If any Vitalis appear, clear them ASAP (1-2 may spawn). On reflect have one person go MD. Clear bleeds as usual, then base debilitate blues after bleeds while bomb sunshines. Repeat until maul. If close enough to maul spot, you can barricade and onslaught instead. DPS should Sunshine drop and make sure to step back to block the Vitalis orb explosion. If any Vitalis spawn, defeat them and keep targeting the Vit until they are dead. You can also place Dominion mines to instantly deal 8k damage to any spawned Vits. Green Bomb Both players Asphyx drop. Person with green bomb steps in and use sun, other person cade cepts. Do as much damage as you can until reflect. Vuln on reflect, but do not step in. Clear bleeds as usual, person who used cade should sun after bleeds, other person debilitate blues. If the green bomb goes on the person who used cade already: Simply cade cept the person with green bomb. Do as much damage until reflect, repeat until maul. If you\u2019re close to maul spot you can Onslaught until maul. If the green bomb goes on the person who didn\u2019t use cade: You will be in your sun, so don\u2019t use too much adren and Devotion + Intercept the person with green bomb. Be prepared to tank a 9.5k hit. Other person will cade cept and both should go MD. Repeat until maul. If you\u2019re close to maul spot you can Onslaught until maul. On larger teams, it is viable to simply pass the green bomb among DPS in the south. Simply Sunshine drop and do as much damage as possible pre-reflect. If the green bomb is on the bomb tank, bridge it from them by standing within two squares of them, then run it into the DPS pile. The green bomb only hits 3 times on this phase, but be wary because you may still take large damage if you are targeted by a green bomb twice.

But, when you break it down into different pieces, it is fairly straight forward. One thing to note is that Yakamaru has a unique mechanic that gives it 100% hit accuracy. If Yaka were to splash, it will deal half damage instead. Keeping this in mind, keeping the appropriate prayers up (mage in md, ranged otherwise) is critical. During the entirety of the fight (including Mirage Phase), Yakamaru will add stacks towards its primary target. These stacks will allow Yakamaru to deal increased damage to anyone with these stacks. This mechanic can be dealt with using Freedom to halve the number of stacks that you have. Unlike AoD, these stacks will not reset your defensive abilities. Drops \u2b25 \u200e \u200e Yakamaru's helmet 1/300 (60 threshold) Presets DPS \u2b25 \u200e \u200e Seismic singularity Flanking 4 \u2b25 \u200e \u200e Rune Pouch \u2b25 \u200e \u200e Rune Pouch \u2b25 \u200e \u200e Rune Pouch (Runes for ) DPS \u2b25 \u200e \u200e Off-hand Ascension crossbow Flanking 4 \u2b25 \u200e \u200e Rune Pouch (Runes for ) DPS \u2b25 \u200e \u200e Off-hand Drygore mace Flanking 4 \u2b25 \u200e \u200e Rune Pouch (Runes for ) North Tank Ancients are recommended to freeze any jelly that spawns on you, while its common to have a JW to deal with them, it's also not uncommon to just let jellies spawn and the team itself works as a whole to prevent their movement. \u2b25 \u200e \u200e Seismic singularity Flanking 4 \u2b25 \u200e \u200e Rune Pouch \u2b25 \u200e \u200e Rune Pouch \u2b25 \u200e \u200e Rune Pouch (Runes for ) Base Tank on Ripper Achto used for defensive resets, arcane used for damage reduction if needed at any point.

This preset ensures you don't stray too far away from the META strategies while at the same time giving you room to breathe in handling this type of basing. This preset also assumes you're camping Standards \u2b25 (Runes for and ) Roles North Tank Also known as NT or Sand Tank. This person must voke and tank the Sand pool during mirage. Since the DPS will be focused on the other 3 pools first, the NT will be tanking mirage for the longest amount of time. That being said, a defensive rotation is advised as well as using , , and shield dome as effectively as possible. A good way of dealing with this pool is using , then using once a good number of stacks are built in order to receive a good heal, then using and other defensive thresholds/ultimates as needed. Jelly Wrangler This person is to tag, voke and drag jellyfish away from the other players during mirage phase. A maximum number of 10 jellyfish can be present in the instance at one point. Using ice barrage is a good way of dealing with the jellyfish as it will affect multiple targets. Using melee prayer and \u200e \u200eis also critical in reducing damage taken. If enough jellyfish surround the JW, it is very easy to get KO'ed. Using defensives is crucial as killing jellyfish in your party will force Yakamaru to spawn another jellyfish near the team. Bolas can also be used if you are ranging. Main Stun Also known as MS. This person will stun Yakamaru during the Stun pool. It is important that this is the ONLY person who stuns the pool. It is also important to note that asphyxiate should NOT be used as main stun; impact/deep impact or their ranged/melee variants will be sufficient. Using stuns during this pool will deal 1000 typeless damage to the whole team and drastically reduce Yakamaru's defense. If another stun is used quickly, the typeless damage can hit up to 5000 typeless damage (in conjunction to the initial 1000). Back-up Stun: Also known as BUS. This person is to stun Yakamaru during the Stun pool ONLY if the MS misses their stun. If the MS misses their stun, they are to call out \"stun missed\", then the BUS will use a stun ability. Again, do NOT use asphyxiate to stun the pool. Double Also known as DBL. This person will act as a poison tank for Stun pool. During Sand pool, you will take the poison from sand (in conjunction with the PT). However, you will not run MD to Yakamaru during Sand pool. You will tank the poison from this point up until Stun pool is defeated. It is important to stand MD to Yakamaru during the entirety of Stun pool (pray mage) and to keep a high HP level as you will be getting hit by mage hits, poison hits, and the occasional stun hit. CPR This person must revive the PT after the pool is phased. The PT will show up on the beach and will have a bar over their head indicating how long you have to revive them. If you do not get to the PT before this bar is depleted, the PT will be instantly killed. Poison Tank Also known as PT. This person must tank the poison for each pool (except for Stun). At 100k HP, Yakamaru will release a poison to a random square and you will have a few seconds to be standing on this square. The designated tile will be at the center of four inward facing green arrows (this looks like detonate). Once you get the confirmation message that you have received the poison, you must rush into melee distance to Yakamaru (pray mage). Once Yakamaru hits 0 HP, you will be taken to the beach (southeast area of the instance) and the CPR will revive you. Make sure to switch ranged prayer here. If the poison tank misses the poison or is not standing MD as the pool dies, the entire pool must be repeated. Stun 0 Also known as St0 or S0. This person must DPS the Stun pool during mirage. This person should also follow the same rotation as St5 but does not need to use any planks. This role is optional as the NT may act as a St0 (this should only be done if you are very experienced). Stun 5 Also known as St5 or S5. These 2 people must take 5 planks from the beach and DPS the Stun pool during mirage. A quick way of dealing with this is tagging the pool, \u2192 \u2192 \u200e \u200eon the pool. Once the pool flies into the air, you and your partner will close the pool with your 5 planks (together, 10 planks are used). Shark 10 Also known as Stag10, SH10, or S10. This person must voke and tank the Shark pool during mirage and then use 10 planks to cover the pool once Yakamaru is defeated. Since most of the DPS will be focused on the Shark pool during mirage, the SH10 will not have to rotate defensive abilities asides from devotion or debilitate. That being said, using devotion then building into / / , using an adrenaline renewal potion and doing a DPS rotation is advised. Once Yakamaru hits 0 HP, it will jump into the air and the SH10 must close the pool with their 10 planks so the pool does not respawn. Mechanics Yakamaru has different mechanics based on the pool he is currently occupying (Choice of tendril, shark, sand, stun, and mid). Map of Yakamaru Pools Sand Pool This is the northwestern pool, it will always follow the shark pool unless Yakamaru dives to the sand pool first. Yakamaru will use the \"Quick Sand\" special attack here. During this attack, Yakamaru will begin burying eight random players in the instance (or however many are in the instance minus 2, so if 8 remain, 6 will be affected). The two free players must click on the other players in order to free them from being isnta-killed. If the base tank is buried, they must be freed as soon as possible. Typically, the 2 unaffected players should free the player closest to them and then immediately free the base tank. If you are affected by the special attack, your defensive abilities (except freedom and anticipation) will be put on cooldown (you can still use Disruption Shield and Shield Dome). Furthermore, you will still be able to attack Yamaru even if you are affected by the Quick Sand attack. Keeping the special attack in mind, the team should be cautious with doing too much or too little DPS around 100k HP. If Yakamaru does the Quick Sand attack in conjunction to releasing the poison, the poison tank and double may not be able to get the poison in time. If Yakamaru is preparing to do the Quick Sand attack and the HP is slightly above 100k, the team should slow down on the DPS. If Yakamaru is close to 0 HP and the poison tank is in position to phase and Yakamaru is preparing to do the Quick Sand attack, the team should either phase ASAP or slow down. This ensures the CPR is free to save the poison tank from the insta-kill. Stun Pool This is the northeastern pool, it will always follow Sand Pool unless Yakamaru dives to Stun Pool first. During this pool, Yakamaru will not gain a special attack, but will gain a special mechanic. This means that Yakamaru's special attack rotation will be: 4 auto attacks, jellyfish, 4 auto attacks, blue, repeat. The unique mechanic that Yakamaru gains is a defensive buff. This buff increases as the fight progresses to the point where Yakamaru will become invulnerable to all attacks except to the style it is weak against. Yakamaru's weakness is indicated by its helmet's color (red for melee, green for ranged, blue for mage) or the text next to Yakamaru's name. This mechanic is bypassed by using a stun ability to drastically lower Yakamaru's defense. Stuns that will proc this are: asphyxiate, deep impact, impact, horror, shock, tight bindings, rout, binding shot, demoralise, destroy, stomp, forceful backhand, backhand, and kick. Dreapnips and dominion tower gloves will not stun the pool. Once a stun is used, Yakamaru will reflect damage to the team, the damage reflected can be anywhere between 1000-5000 damage. This damage scales to Yakamaru's current defense. If Yakamaru has a very high defense and a stun is used, the damage reflected will be closer to 1000. If Yakamaru has a low defense or was recently stunned, the damage will be closer to 5000. If two players stun Yakamaru at the same time, the typeless damage will stack, meaning the team will instantly be hit for 6000 damage. Once Yakamaru is stunned, you should use high hitting abilities and thresholds like snapshot/wild magic/hurricane and use sacrifice (as it can hit up to 10k during this time). Using soulsplit during these thresholds is also advised as it will drastically cut down on food usage if done properly. If your double has done their role properly, you do not need to slow down around 100k HP as you will already have a poison tank ready. A fast way to do this pool is to have everyone heal to full HP and build to full adrenaline, have someone stun, then use onslaught at the same time. If executed properly, this will cut down on kill time fairly noticeably. Shark Pool This is the western most pool, it will always follow the tendril pool unless Yakamaru dives to shark pool first. Yakamaru will use the \"Sharknado\" special attack here. During this attack, Yakamaru will shroud itself in a Sharknado and, after a few attacks, will release the sharks. These sharks will land around Yakamaru and at the feet of every player in the fight. To avoid tanking the ~2 thousand+ typeless damage, you must surge/escape/bladed dive away from the sharks or kick them away. It is highly recommended to surge/escape/bladed dive away as you may kick a shark into the DPS pile. It is very important to note that the sharks will trail you until they land on the ground, meaning that escaping too early will cause a shark to land at your feet and hit you (and other DPS who are near you). One method of dealing with this is having the DPS death dot next to the Tendril pool (southern pool) during this special attack. Only a single shark will land next to the death dot and can easily be kicked away. This method requires extensive communication and is not advised. Immediately after the sharks land, a jellyfish will spawn (as four auto-attacks will have passed). Since the team will be spread out, make sure to bind the jellyfish so that it does not attack the base tank or the DPS pile. As poison tank, it is important to note that there may be more than one shark at your feet as the poison is released. It is advised to bring bladed dive in order to escape from the sharks, dive to the poison, then barge to pool in the event that the \"Sharknado\" special is unleashed as poison is released. Tendril Pool The southern most pool is referred to the \"tendril pool\". In this pool, Yaka will still use the Jellyfish and Blue attacks, but will also use two more mechanics. In this pool, it is imperative that the base tank is the first person who tags the pool, otherwise Yakamaru may unleash a \"Tendril\" special attack into the DPS pile that will deal rapid typeless damage. The special attack order will always follow this: jellyfish, blue, pool special. For the southern pool, the tendril special attack will be the third special. Keeping this in mind, it is possible to use resonance on every single jellyfish spawn outside of middle pool (assuming you tag the jellyfish and Yakamaru does not snipe your res) and maintain a high HP level without eating. The tank will deal with a tendril that will shoot up from the ground and deal rapid typeless damage. This can be negated by using barricade or stepping away from the tendril. The DPS will deal with a \"choke\". This choke will deal small amounts of typeless damage that will affect the top 5 DPSers. The DPS can negate this special attack by doing more damage to Yakamaru. If the DPS does not do enough damage to Yakamaru during the special attack, the choke will deal increasing amounts of damage (up to 2000). Freedom will not clear this (defensives are reset by this special attack). If the poison is released when the top 5 DPSers are choked, you should be prepared to take the poison for this pool and tank it. This is more of a courtesy towards your group and you should indicate if you are covering the role to avoid confusion. As the poison tank, you should be prepared to barge into Yakamaru immediately after receiving the poison to avoid the possibility of being choked outside of melee distance. Make sure you pray magic while standing in melee distance and eat as necessary as the poison will hit you for fairly high damage and cannot be negated by venomblood or antipoison. Mirage Phase After all 4 pools have been completed, there will be 20 planks on the beach (to the southeast) and a number of jellyfish around Yakamaru. At this point, the SH10 and two St5's should get their planks and position themselves near their pools. The NT and Base Tank should also position themselves near their pools as the phase continues. Ideally, the St5's, the St0, NT, and JW should stand to the north of the middle pool. The SH10 and the free DPS should stand to the west of the middle pool. The base tank should stand south of the middle pool. Once the middle pool hits 50k HP, mirage will begin. Each pool will only have 150k HP. The NT will tag the Stun pool to draw aggression and then provoke the Sand pool, then use devotion to negate incoming damage from both pools. The St5's and the St0 will use devotion, drink an adrenaline potion (or replenishment potion), and then use onslaught. The pool should close after a few seconds. Both St5's will click on the pool and use their 5 planks to close the pool. If the pool is not closed, the pool will respawn and must be repeated. It is important to NOT use stuns on this pool, as the stun mechanic will still be present. Stun Pool (Mirage) The NT will tag the Stun pool to draw aggression and then provoke the Sand pool, then use devotion to negate incoming damage from both pools. The St5's and the St0 will use devotion, drink an adrenaline potion (or replenishment potion), and then use onslaught. The pool should close after a few seconds. Both St5's will click on the pool and use their 5 planks to close the pool. If the pool is not closed, the pool will respawn and must be repeated. It is important to NOT use stuns on this pool, as the stun mechanic will still be present. The NT should then move to the north of the Sand pool and the St5's and St0 should move to Shark pool. Shark Pool The SH10 should be positioned to the south of the pool. They will tag the pool, voke, use devotion, build to 100% and then do a DPS rotation. The four free DPS should move to the east of the pool and also do a DPS rotation. If the DPS is optimal, Yakamaru will only unleash two special attacks. Once the pool hits 0 HP, the SH10 will use all 10 planks to cover the pool and then use freedom to halve the number of aggression stacks they have. The SH10 and free DPS should then remain in their sunshines/death's swiftnesses and attack Tendril pool. If the DPS is not sufficient, the SH10 should use resonance, freedom, then rotate defensives to reduce incoming damage. The incoming DPS from the St5's and St0 should be enough and the pool should close. Tendril Pool The Base Tank will be south east of the Tendril Pool and must tank the pool until after Shark Pool is finished. The special attack rotation will remain the same, meaning the Base Tank's rotation should remain the same. Once Shark Pool is closed, the DPS will focus on Tendril Pool and it should be closed before anyone is choked. Once the pool hits 0 HP, the DPS and Base Tank MUST spam click on the pool in order to add buckets of sand and close the pool. Every player can only add 2 buckets of sand, meaning a minimum of 5 people are needed to close the pool on the first try. If the pool isn't closed in time, it must be repeated. If the pool is repeated, the Base Tank must provoke the pool off the DPS or risk having a tendril spawn in the DPS pile. It is important to note that buckets of sand added to the pool during previous attempts will carry over. This means if 6 buckets of sand are added during the first attempt, only 4 buckets of sand are needed to close the pool on the next attempt. Once the pool is over, everyone becomes DPS and moves to Sand pool. Sand Pool The NT will be north of the pool and be tanking auto attacks. Since no one else from the team should be near the pool (until Tendril is defeated), Yakamaru will not use the blue special attack or the Quick Sand attack. However, Jellyfish can still spawn during this pool and will be a problem. You can use stuns/binds/entangle/bolas to deal with Jellyfish, though your JW SHOULD be keeping those off the NT. Once the DPS comes to finish Sand pool, you need to be cautious of the Quick Sand attack. If your NT was rotating DPS rotations during their Barricade/Devotion, the pool should be finished quickly. When the pool hits 0 HP, the team should spam click on the pool and fill it with 10 buckets of sand. If the team is affected by the Quick Sand attack as the pool hits 0 HP, you won't be able to fill the pool with 10 buckets of sand and will be forced to repeat the pool. Mid Pool The Base Tank will tag, provoke, then run west to tank the middle pool after mirage. The DPS should use thresholds and dump their adrenaline as the pool will only have 50k HP. The JW should keep their Jellyfish away from the team during this last portion of the fight The middle pool will utilize the \"jellyfish attack\" and the \"blue\". It is important to note that Yakmaru will use four auto attacks before using a special attack. The jellyfish attack will spawn a jellyfish in the arena and five holes will spawn around it. After a few seconds, the holes will shoot water up and damage everyone standing on them for about two thousand damage. This damage can be negated using resonance or simply standing off of them. What is important to note is that every person who \"tanks\" this special attack by standing on the holes will deal 10 thousand damage to the jellyfish. This means that only five people need to stand on the holes in order to kill the jellyfish. An easy way to deal with this mechanic is to use binding shot (or entangle) on the jellyfish, equip a shield, and use resonance. You can switch to soulsplit and use piercing shot (or wrack/slice) to deal extra damage and finish off the jellyfish. If the mechanic is ignored entirely, the jellyfish will deal quick melee hits to everyone around it. The middle pool will utilize the \"jellyfish attack\" and the \"blue\". It is important to note that Yakmaru will use four auto attacks before using a special attack.

But, when you break it down into different pieces, it is fairly straight forward. One thing to note is that Yakamaru has a unique mechanic that gives it 100% hit accuracy. If Yaka were to splash, it will deal half damage instead. Keeping this in mind, keeping the appropriate prayers up (mage in md, ranged otherwise) is critical. During the entirety of the fight (including Mirage Phase), Yakamaru will add stacks towards its primary target. These stacks will allow Yakamaru to deal increased damage to anyone with these stacks. This mechanic can be dealt with using Freedom to halve the number of stacks that you have.

This person must voke and tank the Sand pool during mirage. Since the DPS will be focused on the other 3 pools first, the NT will be tanking mirage for the longest amount of time. That being said, a defensive rotation is advised as well as using , , and shield dome as effectively as possible. A good way of dealing with this pool is using , then using once a good number of stacks are built in order to receive a good heal, then using and other defensive thresholds/ultimates as needed. Jelly Wrangler This person is to tag, voke and drag jellyfish away from the other players during mirage phase. A maximum number of 10 jellyfish can be present in the instance at one point. Using ice barrage is a good way of dealing with the jellyfish as it will affect multiple targets. Using melee prayer and \u200e \u200eis also critical in reducing damage taken. If enough jellyfish surround the JW, it is very easy to get KO'ed. Using defensives is crucial as killing jellyfish in your party will force Yakamaru to spawn another jellyfish near the team. Bolas can also be used if you are ranging. Main Stun Also known as MS. This person will stun Yakamaru during the Stun pool. It is important that this is the ONLY person who stuns the pool. It is also important to note that asphyxiate should NOT be used as main stun; impact/deep impact or their ranged/melee variants will be sufficient. Using stuns during this pool will deal 1000 typeless damage to the whole team and drastically reduce Yakamaru's defense. If another stun is used quickly, the typeless damage can hit up to 5000 typeless damage (in conjunction to the initial 1000). Back-up Stun: Also known as BUS. This person is to stun Yakamaru during the Stun pool ONLY if the MS misses their stun. If the MS misses their stun, they are to call out \"stun missed\", then the BUS will use a stun ability. Again, do NOT use asphyxiate to stun the pool. Double Also known as DBL. This person will act as a poison tank for Stun pool. During Sand pool, you will take the poison from sand (in conjunction with the PT). However, you will not run MD to Yakamaru during Sand pool. You will tank the poison from this point up until Stun pool is defeated. It is important to stand MD to Yakamaru during the entirety of Stun pool (pray mage) and to keep a high HP level as you will be getting hit by mage hits, poison hits, and the occasional stun hit. CPR This person must revive the PT after the pool is phased. The PT will show up on the beach and will have a bar over their head indicating how long you have to revive them. If you do not get to the PT before this bar is depleted, the PT will be instantly killed. Poison Tank Also known as PT. This person must tank the poison for each pool (except for Stun). At 100k HP, Yakamaru will release a poison to a random square and you will have a few seconds to be standing on this square. The designated tile will be at the center of four inward facing green arrows (this looks like detonate). Once you get the confirmation message that you have received the poison, you must rush into melee distance to Yakamaru (pray mage). Once Yakamaru hits 0 HP, you will be taken to the beach (southeast area of the instance) and the CPR will revive you. Make sure to switch ranged prayer here. If the poison tank misses the poison or is not standing MD as the pool dies, the entire pool must be repeated. Stun 0 Also known as St0 or S0. This person must DPS the Stun pool during mirage. This person should also follow the same rotation as St5 but does not need to use any planks. This role is optional as the NT may act as a St0 (this should only be done if you are very experienced). Stun 5 Also known as St5 or S5. These 2 people must take 5 planks from the beach and DPS the Stun pool during mirage. A quick way of dealing with this is tagging the pool, \u2192 \u2192 \u200e \u200eon the pool. Once the pool flies into the air, you and your partner will close the pool with your 5 planks (together, 10 planks are used). Shark 10 Also known as Stag10, SH10, or S10. This person must voke and tank the Shark pool during mirage and then use 10 planks to cover the pool once Yakamaru is defeated. Since most of the DPS will be focused on the Shark pool during mirage, the SH10 will not have to rotate defensive abilities asides from devotion or debilitate. That being said, using devotion then building into / / , using an adrenaline renewal potion and doing a DPS rotation is advised. Once Yakamaru hits 0 HP, it will jump into the air and the SH10 must close the pool with their 10 planks so the pool does not respawn.","title":"Roles"},{"location":"pvme-guides/high-tier-pvm/yakamaru/#mechanics","text":"Yakamaru has different mechanics based on the pool he is currently occupying (Choice of tendril, shark, sand, stun, and mid). Map of Yakamaru Pools Sand Pool This is the northwestern pool, it will always follow the shark pool unless Yakamaru dives to the sand pool first. Yakamaru will use the \"Quick Sand\" special attack here. During this attack, Yakamaru will begin burying eight random players in the instance (or however many are in the instance minus 2, so if 8 remain, 6 will be affected). The two free players must click on the other players in order to free them from being isnta-killed. If the base tank is buried, they must be freed as soon as possible. Typically, the 2 unaffected players should free the player closest to them and then immediately free the base tank. If you are affected by the special attack, your defensive abilities (except freedom and anticipation) will be put on cooldown (you can still use Disruption Shield and Shield Dome). Furthermore, you will still be able to attack Yamaru even if you are affected by the Quick Sand attack. Keeping the special attack in mind, the team should be cautious with doing too much or too little DPS around 100k HP. If Yakamaru does the Quick Sand attack in conjunction to releasing the poison, the poison tank and double may not be able to get the poison in time. If Yakamaru is preparing to do the Quick Sand attack and the HP is slightly above 100k, the team should slow down on the DPS. If Yakamaru is close to 0 HP and the poison tank is in position to phase and Yakamaru is preparing to do the Quick Sand attack, the team should either phase ASAP or slow down. This ensures the CPR is free to save the poison tank from the insta-kill. Stun Pool This is the northeastern pool, it will always follow Sand Pool unless Yakamaru dives to Stun Pool first. During this pool, Yakamaru will not gain a special attack, but will gain a special mechanic. This means that Yakamaru's special attack rotation will be: 4 auto attacks, jellyfish, 4 auto attacks, blue, repeat. The unique mechanic that Yakamaru gains is a defensive buff. This buff increases as the fight progresses to the point where Yakamaru will become invulnerable to all attacks except to the style it is weak against. Yakamaru's weakness is indicated by its helmet's color (red for melee, green for ranged, blue for mage) or the text next to Yakamaru's name. This mechanic is bypassed by using a stun ability to drastically lower Yakamaru's defense. Stuns that will proc this are: asphyxiate, deep impact, impact, horror, shock, tight bindings, rout, binding shot, demoralise, destroy, stomp, forceful backhand, backhand, and kick. Dreapnips and dominion tower gloves will not stun the pool. Once a stun is used, Yakamaru will reflect damage to the team, the damage reflected can be anywhere between 1000-5000 damage. This damage scales to Yakamaru's current defense. If Yakamaru has a very high defense and a stun is used, the damage reflected will be closer to 1000. If Yakamaru has a low defense or was recently stunned, the damage will be closer to 5000. If two players stun Yakamaru at the same time, the typeless damage will stack, meaning the team will instantly be hit for 6000 damage. Once Yakamaru is stunned, you should use high hitting abilities and thresholds like snapshot/wild magic/hurricane and use sacrifice (as it can hit up to 10k during this time). Using soulsplit during these thresholds is also advised as it will drastically cut down on food usage if done properly. If your double has done their role properly, you do not need to slow down around 100k HP as you will already have a poison tank ready. A fast way to do this pool is to have everyone heal to full HP and build to full adrenaline, have someone stun, then use onslaught at the same time. If executed properly, this will cut down on kill time fairly noticeably. Shark Pool This is the western most pool, it will always follow the tendril pool unless Yakamaru dives to shark pool first. Yakamaru will use the \"Sharknado\" special attack here. During this attack, Yakamaru will shroud itself in a Sharknado and, after a few attacks, will release the sharks. These sharks will land around Yakamaru and at the feet of every player in the fight. To avoid tanking the ~2 thousand+ typeless damage, you must surge/escape/bladed dive away from the sharks or kick them away. It is highly recommended to surge/escape/bladed dive away as you may kick a shark into the DPS pile. It is very important to note that the sharks will trail you until they land on the ground, meaning that escaping too early will cause a shark to land at your feet and hit you (and other DPS who are near you). One method of dealing with this is having the DPS death dot next to the Tendril pool (southern pool) during this special attack. Only a single shark will land next to the death dot and can easily be kicked away. This method requires extensive communication and is not advised. Immediately after the sharks land, a jellyfish will spawn (as four auto-attacks will have passed). Since the team will be spread out, make sure to bind the jellyfish so that it does not attack the base tank or the DPS pile. As poison tank, it is important to note that there may be more than one shark at your feet as the poison is released. It is advised to bring bladed dive in order to escape from the sharks, dive to the poison, then barge to pool in the event that the \"Sharknado\" special is unleashed as poison is released. Tendril Pool The southern most pool is referred to the \"tendril pool\". In this pool, Yaka will still use the Jellyfish and Blue attacks, but will also use two more mechanics. In this pool, it is imperative that the base tank is the first person who tags the pool, otherwise Yakamaru may unleash a \"Tendril\" special attack into the DPS pile that will deal rapid typeless damage. The special attack order will always follow this: jellyfish, blue, pool special. For the southern pool, the tendril special attack will be the third special. Keeping this in mind, it is possible to use resonance on every single jellyfish spawn outside of middle pool (assuming you tag the jellyfish and Yakamaru does not snipe your res) and maintain a high HP level without eating. The tank will deal with a tendril that will shoot up from the ground and deal rapid typeless damage. This can be negated by using barricade or stepping away from the tendril. The DPS will deal with a \"choke\". This choke will deal small amounts of typeless damage that will affect the top 5 DPSers. The DPS can negate this special attack by doing more damage to Yakamaru. If the DPS does not do enough damage to Yakamaru during the special attack, the choke will deal increasing amounts of damage (up to 2000). Freedom will not clear this (defensives are reset by this special attack). If the poison is released when the top 5 DPSers are choked, you should be prepared to take the poison for this pool and tank it. This is more of a courtesy towards your group and you should indicate if you are covering the role to avoid confusion. As the poison tank, you should be prepared to barge into Yakamaru immediately after receiving the poison to avoid the possibility of being choked outside of melee distance. Make sure you pray magic while standing in melee distance and eat as necessary as the poison will hit you for fairly high damage and cannot be negated by venomblood or antipoison. Mirage Phase After all 4 pools have been completed, there will be 20 planks on the beach (to the southeast) and a number of jellyfish around Yakamaru. At this point, the SH10 and two St5's should get their planks and position themselves near their pools. The NT and Base Tank should also position themselves near their pools as the phase continues. Ideally, the St5's, the St0, NT, and JW should stand to the north of the middle pool. The SH10 and the free DPS should stand to the west of the middle pool. The base tank should stand south of the middle pool. Once the middle pool hits 50k HP, mirage will begin. Each pool will only have 150k HP. The NT will tag the Stun pool to draw aggression and then provoke the Sand pool, then use devotion to negate incoming damage from both pools. The St5's and the St0 will use devotion, drink an adrenaline potion (or replenishment potion), and then use onslaught. The pool should close after a few seconds. Both St5's will click on the pool and use their 5 planks to close the pool. If the pool is not closed, the pool will respawn and must be repeated. It is important to NOT use stuns on this pool, as the stun mechanic will still be present. Stun Pool (Mirage) The NT will tag the Stun pool to draw aggression and then provoke the Sand pool, then use devotion to negate incoming damage from both pools. The St5's and the St0 will use devotion, drink an adrenaline potion (or replenishment potion), and then use onslaught. The pool should close after a few seconds. Both St5's will click on the pool and use their 5 planks to close the pool. If the pool is not closed, the pool will respawn and must be repeated. It is important to NOT use stuns on this pool, as the stun mechanic will still be present. The NT should then move to the north of the Sand pool and the St5's and St0 should move to Shark pool. Shark Pool The SH10 should be positioned to the south of the pool. They will tag the pool, voke, use devotion, build to 100% and then do a DPS rotation. The four free DPS should move to the east of the pool and also do a DPS rotation. If the DPS is optimal, Yakamaru will only unleash two special attacks. Once the pool hits 0 HP, the SH10 will use all 10 planks to cover the pool and then use freedom to halve the number of aggression stacks they have. The SH10 and free DPS should then remain in their sunshines/death's swiftnesses and attack Tendril pool. If the DPS is not sufficient, the SH10 should use resonance, freedom, then rotate defensives to reduce incoming damage. The incoming DPS from the St5's and St0 should be enough and the pool should close. Tendril Pool The Base Tank will be south east of the Tendril Pool and must tank the pool until after Shark Pool is finished. The special attack rotation will remain the same, meaning the Base Tank's rotation should remain the same. Once Shark Pool is closed, the DPS will focus on Tendril Pool and it should be closed before anyone is choked. Once the pool hits 0 HP, the DPS and Base Tank MUST spam click on the pool in order to add buckets of sand and close the pool. Every player can only add 2 buckets of sand, meaning a minimum of 5 people are needed to close the pool on the first try. If the pool isn't closed in time, it must be repeated. If the pool is repeated, the Base Tank must provoke the pool off the DPS or risk having a tendril spawn in the DPS pile. It is important to note that buckets of sand added to the pool during previous attempts will carry over. This means if 6 buckets of sand are added during the first attempt, only 4 buckets of sand are needed to close the pool on the next attempt. Once the pool is over, everyone becomes DPS and moves to Sand pool. Sand Pool The NT will be north of the pool and be tanking auto attacks. Since no one else from the team should be near the pool (until Tendril is defeated), Yakamaru will not use the blue special attack or the Quick Sand attack. However, Jellyfish can still spawn during this pool and will be a problem. You can use stuns/binds/entangle/bolas to deal with Jellyfish, though your JW SHOULD be keeping those off the NT. Once the DPS comes to finish Sand pool, you need to be cautious of the Quick Sand attack. If your NT was rotating DPS rotations during their Barricade/Devotion, the pool should be finished quickly. When the pool hits 0 HP, the team should spam click on the pool and fill it with 10 buckets of sand. If the team is affected by the Quick Sand attack as the pool hits 0 HP, you won't be able to fill the pool with 10 buckets of sand and will be forced to repeat the pool. Mid Pool The Base Tank will tag, provoke, then run west to tank the middle pool after mirage. The DPS should use thresholds and dump their adrenaline as the pool will only have 50k HP. The JW should keep their Jellyfish away from the team during this last portion of the fight The middle pool will utilize the \"jellyfish attack\" and the \"blue\". It is important to note that Yakmaru will use four auto attacks before using a special attack. The jellyfish attack will spawn a jellyfish in the arena and five holes will spawn around it. After a few seconds, the holes will shoot water up and damage everyone standing on them for about two thousand damage. This damage can be negated using resonance or simply standing off of them. What is important to note is that every person who \"tanks\" this special attack by standing on the holes will deal 10 thousand damage to the jellyfish. This means that only five people need to stand on the holes in order to kill the jellyfish. An easy way to deal with this mechanic is to use binding shot (or entangle) on the jellyfish, equip a shield, and use resonance. You can switch to soulsplit and use piercing shot (or wrack/slice) to deal extra damage and finish off the jellyfish. If the mechanic is ignored entirely, the jellyfish will deal quick melee hits to everyone around it. The middle pool will utilize the \"jellyfish attack\" and the \"blue\". It is important to note that Yakmaru will use four auto attacks before using a special attack.","title":"Mechanics"},{"location":"pvme-guides/high-tier-pvm/yakamaru/#learning-raids","text":"If you're interested in learning raids, join this boss school link and check out the pins there to get started! https://discord.gg/C9hjNWY","title":"Learning Raids"},{"location":"pvme-guides/information/contribution-quick-start/","text":"Contribution quick start This guide covers how to get started with contributing to PVME.

If you followed the lore behind the quest, you will understand why summoning familiars cannot be used at the boss, meaning that you can only use the items in your inventory. A legendary pet can be used here. Furthermore, any weapon that isn't a spear will deal half damage, meaning that melee is the only style you should use. Drops The droprate for obtaining a sigil is 1/512 . If a player rolls the sigil drop table, there is a 1/5 chance of Arcane, 1/5 chance of Divine, 1/5 chance of Elysian, and 2/5 chance of Spectral. \u2b25 \u200e \u200e Spirit shield 1/64 \u2b25 \u200e \u200e Holy elixir 1/171 \u2b25 \u200e \u200e Spectral sigil \u2b25 \u200e \u200e Arcane sigil \u2b25 \u200e \u200e Divine sigil \u2b25 \u200e \u200e Elysian sigil \u2b25 \u200e \u200e Corporeal bone 1/2500 (500 threshold) Presets As stated before, any weapon that isn't a spear will deal half damage so melee is the only style that should be used at this boss. If you don't have a T92 spear then Reaper necklace is greatly preferred over the amulet of souls, as you do not have 100% hit chance. The Masuta's Warspear does work at Corporeal Beast (tested on approximately 200+ kills) and may be used in a solo situation as you will not have to prayer flick for melee swipes, however this is less optimal. Weapon Poison will stack with the cinderbanes effect. A vampirism scrimshaw will help sustain longer trips, and a cannon can be used for extra damage output (Kinetic cyclone is used over coil as it does more damage, albeit at the cost of range. However the range is a non issue at corp). Jellyfish and brews can be used for general healing without adrenaline loss. \u2b25 \u200e \u200e Rune Pouch (Runes for ) AFK Preset (~55 kph) (Credit to @!159421704270118912 ) This method will net a lower amount of kills per hour but may be used if you do not wish to put in high amounts of effort into a mid level boss. It is useful for title/pet hunting however there are a few prerequisites in order to sustain yourself. For this method it is important to have 3 things: \u2b25 \u200e \u200e Masterwork Spear \u2b25 / \u200e \u200e Amulet of souls \u2b25 \u200e \u200e Penance Aura \u2b25 \u200e \u200e Persistent Rage relic Action Bar Cannon Placement Mechanics The Corporeal Beast will only attack with magic attacks if you are outside of melee distance. If you are within melee distance, the boss will use both styles. Melee swipes are noticeable when the boss swipes with its front two legs. Also, protection prayers will not halve incoming damage, it will only partially reduce damage. Magic attacks will do an aoe splash on their target in a 3x3 square. This means you should stand at least 2 squares away from your partner(s), if applicable. Occasionally, a dark core will spawn and jump towards its target. This dark core will do constant typeless damage and will heal the boss unless it is killed or you step away from it. It will do typeless hits unless you are more than 1 square away. Also a white core may spawn, this has a chance to drain magic, prayer or summoning stats. If your stats are already at 0 (no prayer or summoning points, for example), then you will get hit for extra damage instead. An overload or super restore can negate this special attack entirely. Advanced corp killing strat (~100 kph if done well) Misc thing to have: Legendary pet for picking items (Do not add a familiar, just summon the legendary pet), cannon with autorefill, disruption shield, zgs spec. None of these are mandatory but the less you have the less kills you will get. Not owning a zgs probably lowers kph by around 10. Corp is an outdated boss with slow spawn times, thanks to it having an easily accessible public instance you can abuse and this is what the method is based on. Kills will be alternated between the public and private instances. Corp has the mechanic where he only takes full damage from spears, though there is a way get around which increases your kills if used enough. It is done in these steps: Run out of md Cast the dw ability you want to use and click the ground Equip your spear and click corp (you only use decimate and gflurry). This gives you another 188 ability to use and pretty much cuts out smash and worse abilities from your rotation. Rotations for corp: Non-instanced corp: \u2192 \u2192 (stall for 1st hit)> \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 improvise as it is near death. Instanced corp: Auto + \u2192 \u2192 asap + / \u200e \u200ebased on cd (don't use sever on corp unless you are under 60% adren) \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 improvise. Optional rotations for no zgs: These arent necesarily optimal but instead of throwing a zgs spec (because you don't own one) You will abuse slaughter and tendrils as they are very good. Looks roughly like: \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 improvise. Tips/notes Since the kills are so fast you can leave the non instanced loot on the ground every other kill. When corp dies call your legendary pet and renew cannon (if needed) and exit. You can leave the loot on the ground in the world instance and every other kill you can go loot the old loot along with the new and leave. For instanced kills, you let your pet pick up the loot. After it has visually taken the loot you wait 2-4 ticks and click exit (1 tick before it's in invent you can leave and still get it). During an hour you should bank twice. This method is recommended to everyone intending to do corp even if you aren't the most experienced player, since this just kills most of the waiting time essentially increasing your efficiency. The dark core doesn't use up your disruption shield. So you can ss camp with it even if the core is on you.

If you are within melee distance, the boss will use both styles. Melee swipes are noticeable when the boss swipes with its front two legs. Also, protection prayers will not halve incoming damage, it will only partially reduce damage. Magic attacks will do an aoe splash on their target in a 3x3 square. This means you should stand at least 2 squares away from your partner(s), if applicable. Occasionally, a dark core will spawn and jump towards its target. This dark core will do constant typeless damage and will heal the boss unless it is killed or you step away from it. It will do typeless hits unless you are more than 1 square away. Also a white core may spawn, this has a chance to drain magic, prayer or summoning stats. If your stats are already at 0 (no prayer or summoning points, for example), then you will get hit for extra damage instead.

None of these are mandatory but the less you have the less kills you will get. Not owning a zgs probably lowers kph by around 10. Corp is an outdated boss with slow spawn times, thanks to it having an easily accessible public instance you can abuse and this is what the method is based on.

Corp has the mechanic where he only takes full damage from spears, though there is a way get around which increases your kills if used enough. It is done in these steps: Run out of md Cast the dw ability you want to use and click the ground Equip your spear and click corp (you only use decimate and gflurry).

It is recommended to go in a group of 3 when starting out. Categorized as mid tier PvM, the encounter is useful for anyone wanting to learn how to deal with large mobs as well as bosses, combining aspects of single target and AoE damage. It is encouraged to read up on the mechanics here: https://runescape.wiki/w/Dragonkin_Laboratory/Strategies The mechanics are relatively straightforward, and can be mostly ignored in trio. For explanations of optimal strategies, it is worthwhile to read the solo guide, and simply have everyone in your group follow the strategies listed. Auras : Standard combat auras should be used, with Zerk auras taking precedence over accuracy auras. Presets Beginner/Group Magic Food can be swapped out for summoning flasks or vice versa, as needed. Cinderbanes are used as many things in the encounter are poisonable. Generally solid food is fine, as you are typically only healing between encounters, so the adrenaline loss is acceptable. More charms can be brought if needed.

If you have slimes following you (cause you're not big brain) you need to surge past the red dragons and they will get blocked behind them. Slimes get blocked very easily which can be utilized multiple times throughout the section. Room 3 : Surge to the back of the bridge and detonate + aoe spam, tsunami, etc. You only need to kill like 3 golems to proceed but you can catch them all in aoes very easily, Room 4 : The optimal way to do this room depends on the positioning of the slimes and books right as the barrier goes down. If you are immediately aggroed by multiple slimes+books: entangle and clear them from the bridge. If you draw only slime aggro, look to surge+bd behind the celestial (slimes will get blocked). You must kill the celestial + several slimes to pass this room so if you draw no aggro at all you must manually tag some slimes to bring behind the celestial. Room 5 : 90% of the time you will have extra enemies following you from the previous room so surge past the 3 celestials and sun at the back of the room (extra books, slimes, golems will be blocked). Sun there and clear the celestials (If you have dom mines, now would be a good time to start using them). Room 6 : just dps, maybe sun Section 2 Room 1 : Spider aggro is aids here, surge + bd immediately east here and depending on how many spiders come along you may need to clear them first. Clear the two lava strykes at the end to proceed If lots of aggro is drawn, stand here to stack. Room 2 : Sun in the middle of the black dragons and clear them Room 3 : Surge to the end of the path while dpsing the dragons and sun when it comes up, you need to kill every black dragon here to proceed Room 4 : You must kill 4/6 lava strykes to proceed, sun at the end of the path right next to the barrier to clear the last 2 Room 5 : Your sun from the previous room will still be ongoing to clear the 3 black dragons at the start, build to 100 at the last dragon at the end of the path for the boss Section 3 Super straightforward just spam dom mines and sun/meta at those spots, you can skip the two onyx dragons at the start and the 2 hydrix dragons in the middle Astellarn, the First Celestial This fight heavily utilizes punishing area-of-effect mechanics but is still very straightforward and easy to master with some practice. Tag Astellarn to start the fight and begin DPSing. After 2-3 autoattacks a Pulsar will spawn with 20,000 hitpoints, dealing moderate periodic damage. Ideally, you would want to have saved either Wild Magic or Asphyxiate (Snapshot or Rapid Fire for ranged) to kill this as quickly as possible. Shortly after, a bar will appear above the player's head and a wyrmhole will spawn at their current location when it fills. Place the wyrmhole along these lines to prevent it from being blocked out by the later rain mechanic. When the wyrmhole spawns, it will deal continuous damage to anyone standing in it. Step away and continue dpsing until the Neutron Star spawns. This will follow the player around and must be lured into the wyrmhole. If the Neutron Star touches a player, it will explode, dealing 5000 damage and it is highly recommended to teleport out and restart the fight in this case. The wymhole will become stabilized and turn white if this mechanic is dealt with properly, allowing you to stand in it and deal increased damage to Astellarn for it's duration. Use a damage boosting ultimate inside of it and do as much damage as possible. A good DPS rotation can get Astellarn down to 150k-90k hitpoints by the end of the first wyrmhole. The celestial rain will begin once the boss reaches 200,000 hitpoints. This will spawn a continuous rain in a random quadrant that deals increasing damage as long as it is stood in. This will change quadrants occasionally and will only be a major issue if the wyrmhole was placed improperly. From here on, these mechanics repeat with the rain lasting for the remainder of the encounter. Verak Lith This boss fight follows a very predictable attack rotation but deals consistent moderately high damage so it is recommended to learn the few mechanics properly to avoid any unnecessary deaths. It will always melee auto attack when the player is in melee distance and always mage otherwise. The auto attacks hit quite hard and specifically the mage ones are desynced visually so it is important to not mess up too many prayer flicks here. Verak Lith's Attack Rotation 4 Auto attacks Spire 4 Auto attacks Ricochet 4 Auto attacks Spire 4 Auto Attacks Nosedive/Hurricanes Repeat Mechanics Spire The message \"Verak Lith slams his tail against the ground, the earth shakes beneath your feet!\" will appear and after a short delay and spire with 15,000 hitpoints will spawn near the player. The boss will be immune to damage while the spire is alive so it is good to threshold to get it down immediately. The spawn will also be accompanied by a moderate melee hit that should be resonanced. In a typical kill, this will be the primary method alongside soul split flicking to restore hp. Ricochet Verak Lith will send out a projectile that lands at a spot around the player after a few seconds. The element of this projectile can be poison, ice, or shock, and corresponds with the three groups of eggs found around the arena. The correct way to deal with this mechanic is to pick up the projectile and interact with a DIFFERENT type of egg to disperse it before the bar fills up. Missing the projectile will deal 4000 damage and missing the dispersal can deal 9000+ damage so it is especially important not to miss the second half of this mechanic. Generally, if the projectile matches the element of the nearest group of eggs to the player, it should be ignored with debilitate or reflect (or nothing if the player is high hp). This will end the mechanic early. Nosedive A message will appear on the screen mentioning that a dragon is nosediving. An arrow will show up near the player to indicate the direction the dragon is approaching from and, after a short delay, a thin line of dragonbreath will be fired along the line the arrow is pointing. This can deal over 8000 magic damage and can be avoided by simply moving out of the way. However, the arrow will adjust it's position based on the player's movement for a short period so it is recommended to learn the timing on this mechanic and move as it goes off. Hurricanes Verak Lith will say \"Let the flames melt the flesh from your bones\" and engulf the area around the player in fire. This will deal no damage but after a short delay, hurricanes will spawn in the area that deal extremely high damage and last for roughly 20 seconds. This is a fairly large area attack and should be surged from to be a safe distance away. It isn't very complicated however, simply don't touch a hurricane. The last two mechanics occur after each Spire > Ricochet > Spire cycle and rotate starting from Nosedive. A good dps rotation can end the fight shortly after the first hurricanes. Black Stone Dragon The Black Stone Dragon is the final boss encounter in the Dragonkin Laboratory and is the main source of the dungeon's primary unique: Draconic Energies, which are used to make the mage t92 Elite Tectonic set. It also drops the Mutated Barge Codex, which sees frequent use in endgame melee encounters. This fight consists of fairly simple mechanics but can be very punishing if mistakes are made. It is also one of the few bosses to auto attack in all three combat styles, with melee hitting especially hard, so it is possible to die just from auto attacks if the player can't outheal with soul split, is low on food, and/or can't prayer flick the fight. Attack Rotation Phase 1 3 Auto Attacks Gemstone Spikes 2 Auto Attacks Dragonbreath Repeat Phase 2 (Black Hands) Phase 3 1-5 Auto Attacks Smoke Spiral 3 Auto Attacks Mage AoE 2 Auto Attacks Dragonbreath Gemstone Spikes 3 Auto Attacks Mage AoE Repeat Mechanics Gemstone Spikes This mechanic occurs a few auto attacks into the start of the fight and after each dragonbreath after phase 1. This is identical to the hydrix dragon special attack where a line of spikes are shot through the ground and erupt under the player. This deals 5000+ melee damage and drains all adrenaline upon impact. It will also apply a debuff that reduces all adrenaline gain by 50% for a short duration. Simply move out of the way when this comes out. Dragonbreath The skybox will turn dark blue and Black Stone Dragon will fire a 100% accuracy mage attack that deals moderate damage. This is essentially just a mage auto attack that hits slightly harder but signals that the spikes are coming out immediately after (phase 3). Black Hands (phase 2) After reaching 515k-500k hp, phase 2 will begin. This is signaled by Black Stone Dragon moving to the center of the arena and 4 black hands with 80,000 hp each spawning where the rocks are located. These hands will slam the ground regularly and send out a very heavy mage auto if they are in range of the player. Shortly after, a line of small hands will move towards the player that deal rapid 2000+ damage if stood on. These hands will NEVER reach the player if they are standing in one of the four spots pictured above. The phase will end when all 4 hands are dead, dominion mines are highly recommended here as you can potentially use 6 if you placed some during phase 1. Smoke Spiral A line of smoke will spiral inwards towards Black Stone Dragon, dealing 4000+ damage per tick if stood on. The boss will remain stationary during this time so flanking is possible here. It is recommended to learn where you can stand safely to avoid having to cancel channeled abilities. Generally, a max range sunshine/death swiftness to the sides of the boss will provide decent freedom of movement and allow for flanking. Do not sunshine in the center of the arena as Steel Titans cannot be called into that area for some reason. Mage AoE Black Stone Dragon will call out \"GET. OUT. OF. ME.\" or \"The shadow overwhelms!\" and turn to fire a black projectile towards a random spot in the arena. This is very similar to Verak Lith's hurricanes special and will explode into black tendrils that deal 4000+ damage in the area for a short period. In a solo encounter, this will miss most of the time and isn't a big concern. The boss can also be flanked when it turns to send out the special. Fly Upon hitting 250,000 hp, Black Stone Dragon will become invulnerable and fly around the arena, landing at various spots and sending out smoke lines towards the player each time. Additional lines will also spawn out of existing ones on each land, so movement can get hectic if the boss lands at the same area multiple times. This smoke is functionally identical to the type in the spiral mechanic and should be avoided at all costs. This will occur 7 times before the boss becomes vulnerable again and continues the phase 3 rotation starting from smoke spiral. The lines will not spawn if the boss lands out of range but it is still highly recommended to follow and use an ability after each landing as the boss will take longer to fly again if the player stays far away.

These hands will slam the ground regularly and send out a very heavy mage auto if they are in range of the player. Shortly after, a line of small hands will move towards the player that deal rapid 2000+ damage if stood on. These hands will NEVER reach the player if they are standing in one of the four spots pictured above. The phase will end when all 4 hands are dead, dominion mines are highly recommended here as you can potentially use 6 if you placed some during phase 1. Smoke Spiral A line of smoke will spiral inwards towards Black Stone Dragon, dealing 4000+ damage per tick if stood on. The boss will remain stationary during this time so flanking is possible here. It is recommended to learn where you can stand safely to avoid having to cancel channeled abilities. Generally, a max range sunshine/death swiftness to the sides of the boss will provide decent freedom of movement and allow for flanking. Do not sunshine in the center of the arena as Steel Titans cannot be called into that area for some reason. Mage AoE Black Stone Dragon will call out \"GET. OUT. OF. ME.\" or \"The shadow overwhelms!\" and turn to fire a black projectile towards a random spot in the arena. This is very similar to Verak Lith's hurricanes special and will explode into black tendrils that deal 4000+ damage in the area for a short period. In a solo encounter, this will miss most of the time and isn't a big concern. The boss can also be flanked when it turns to send out the special. Fly Upon hitting 250,000 hp, Black Stone Dragon will become invulnerable and fly around the arena, landing at various spots and sending out smoke lines towards the player each time. Additional lines will also spawn out of existing ones on each land, so movement can get hectic if the boss lands at the same area multiple times. This smoke is functionally identical to the type in the spiral mechanic and should be avoided at all costs. This will occur 7 times before the boss becomes vulnerable again and continues the phase 3 rotation starting from smoke spiral. The lines will not spawn if the boss lands out of range but it is still highly recommended to follow and use an ability after each landing as the boss will take longer to fly again if the player stays far away.

This is generally due to his high accuracy and hard hits. For Gregorovic, it is HIGHLY recommended to use irit incense sticks at maximum potency, as it will nullify his poison mechanics entirely. The recommended method of killing Gregorovic involves using a halberd range weapon, such as a scythe, and toggling run off. Stand in the Northwest Corner of the arena, and pot up. Wait for Gregorovic to spawn and walk over to you. Stand at least 2 squares away (max halberd range), and DPS him down, handling mechanics as they come up. Summon spirits can be ignored as with this positioning, he will absorb the poisoning spirit, which has no effect due to the immunity provided by incense sticks. Dodge the shadow spots if they spawn, and continue to DPS.

It is very effective for title/pet hunting however there are a few prerequisites in order to sustain yourself. It is important to pray as you will be standing in melee distance optimally as the Masterwork spear of annihilation is BiS. You can substitute the spear for a Terrasaur Maul or Noxious Scythe.

The following specs are his main spec rotation, there are 3 autos between each spec, and the fight is started with 3 autos before the first spec occurs Bouncing blade The first special attack occurs after 3 autos and he will throw a blade that bounces between you, other players if available, and then himself (it will not damage him), it will hit players 3 times, whether thats one player 3 times or 3 players 1 time each. Summon Spirits He will summon a spirit dependent on the area of the room that he's standing in, that will walk towards him. If it reaches melee distance of him it will be consumed granting Greg a buff based on the spirit summoned. The ghosts that are summoned are the spirts of Mania, Rage, and Delirium.

Accessing them requires an Ascension Keystone. They each have a unique mechanic which are detailed below. As ascension members, Legiones can only be efficiently harmed with ranged, as they have extremely low affinity against magic and melee attacks. They are very good for learning how to move around and avoid mechanics while still doing damage. Simply get into MD of the boss (this is due to you doing more damage the closer you are), double bleed and walk your fragmentation shot. Then, do your best range threshold rotation (i.e. Snapshot and Rapidfire; avoid Shadow Tendrils as Legiones have a hit cap of 7.5k). Finish the kill with basics. Ideally, kill times should be consistently sub 20 seconds. Bring your best range gear, and as many keys as you are comfortable bringing. Use excalibur spec to heal up, and adrenaline potion as needed. A bladed dive switch can be used to maneuver away from mechanics, as well as to start the next encounter quickly.

They take increased damage the closer the player is to them which is why it is recommended to try to stay close to the legio during the fight. Primus Legio Primus' unique ability is that the lower life points he has, the more damage he will deal. For every 25% life points that Primus loses, his lightning orb attacks gain 200 extra damage. Using the hit-and-run tactic as normal nullifies this ability, however it is best to eat up as being caught in the middle of a lightning attack can cause massive damage. Secundus Legio Secundus' unique ability is using the lightning orb attack more frequently as his life points lower. At 75% health, he will use three orb attacks, then one basic magic attack. At 50%, he uses a simple magic attack every four orbs, and at 25% he will exclusively attack with lightning. This is generally not a problem as using the hit-and-run tactic as normal will nullify this ability, however the lightning orbs will be more frequent so having high life points is advantageous when most of his are depleted. Tertius Legio Tertius' unique ability is summoning Monastery of Ascension units as his health lowers - 3 Rorarii, 1 Gladius and 1 Capsarius when he reaches 75%, 50% and 25% of his health respectively. The ascended spawn under Tertius, so they will can be damaged easily with Corruption Shot and Bombardment. The Gladius can be somewhat problematic, but since Legiones take increased damage the closer the player is to them, the Gladius is unlikely to move out from Corruption Shot and Bombardment will only force him to move away from the pile. Should he be able to land a stun, immediately use Freedom and quickly move away before the lightning attack strikes. Any remaining minions after Tertius is killed will die. Quartus Legio Quartus' unique ability is teleporting the player next to him when he reaches 75%, 50% and 25% life points and launching an additional lightning attack at/around the spot he teleported the player, on top of his regular attacks. Quartus is the only Legio where damage should be dealt carefully, as his ability can punish fast DPS players. If the player damages him too fast, then Quartus will pull the player back to the same spot when he first triggers his ability, resulting in two immediate lightning strikes dead-center which will quickly shred a player's health if Devotion is not used. Quartus' drag is unique compared to other monsters - Freedom and Anticipation do not work, as it isn't classified as a stun attack. The pull also grants him a second of invulnerability, and any channeled abilities used when he drags the player are simply put on hold for the same time, after which it is cast as normal again. Quintus Legio Quintus' unique ability is summoning \"Lines of Ascension\" in the laboratory when he reaches 75%, 50% and 25% life points. This is a very dangerous mechanic and makes Quintus the most deadly of the Legiones. Accidentally running into lines and getting caught by orb attacks can easily kill a player regardless of experience. The first and third lines he summons will run horizontally, while the second line runs vertically. Stepping on one of these lines will deal incredibly heavy damage (more than the lighting strike in terms of individual damage) - however, it only hits once each time the player runs into a line, but due to the lightning orb attacks, you'll be forced to move regardless. It is worth noting that the player can \"force\" the lines to spawn as when he reaches 75%, 50% and 25% life points respectively, a line will spawn wherever the player is currently. Doing this near the edges of the laboratory will effectively nullify them if they perform the hit-and-run tactic while keeping away from them completely - however, players should note that he will take less damage the further you are from him, so this is only recommended for inexperienced players. Tip: The \"Lines of Ascension\" are extremely similar to the Queen Black Dragon's fire walls - if you stand next to a line, then run over it, you will not take any damage from the line itself. This can allow for easier maneuverability around him to deal maximum damage without having to bring him closer. Sextus Legio Sextus' unique ability is his lightning attacks - unlike the other Legiones, his attacks are not modified as his health decreases. Sextus' lightning attacks last significantly longer than his fellow Legiones, as they only start to dissipate once three strikes are on the field. In addition to the increased duration of these attacks, their AoE is increased from 4x4 to 5x5. This should be kept in mind while running around; doing so in an erratic way is not advised as the larger radius and prolonged duration can potentially slow down kills, though his laboratory is fairly large to avoid these attacks while dealing as much damage as possible. Sextus is fairly easy to kill, much like Primus and Secundus. Manipulating Attacks A more advanced technique worth discussing is the ability to manipulate where legiones will drop their lightning balls. This involves abusing the fact that their mechanics are based on where you click, and the fact that movement can be stopped by using an ability.

When Nex spawns for the first time in a custom instance it will be praying against mage for the majority of the kill, this is why range only kills are the meta for fast consistent kills. After every kill you will teleport out of the instance and re-enter in order to force Nex to always be praying mage. Nex is a 1x1 NPC and has very strict softcaps, which means that any damage over a certain amount is reduced by X% depending on the phase. During the first four phases, Nex has a soft cap that reduces excess damage above 5,000 by 50% . For example, a 6,000 damage hit would be reduced to 5,500 damage. On the Zaros phase, the soft cap is changed to reduce excess damage above 2,000 by 75% . This means a 6,000-damage hit would be reduced to 3,000. Nex's mages have a soft cap that reduces excess damage above 1,000 by a random amount between approximately 80% and 100%. Each mage is combat level 111 with 10,000 health, possesses a max hit of around 850, and are weak to bolts. The mages are static and can only be attacked whenever Nex calls their name. An unusual trait they all share is that they are immune to magic attacks.

Standing in this white box will cause Nex to walk the fragmentation shot bleed. From here you will end ice phase with a tendril(auto) + snap most of the time, if not just use a basic. You will then immediately surge towards the 4th minion Glacies (angle your camera so that you can click Glacies as soon as you reach him). If for any reason Nex comes into the red box as described in the 2nd picture, then you will carry out the ice phase rotation while running towards glacies as this will most likely kite Nex and dodge contain.

Make sure to surge from the red. This timing should be mastered and is essential to blood phase. If you don't get a ruby proc, you'll probably need to go back for a snipe. Don't get discouraged! Even experienced PvMers find this phase hard. If you need to, tele out and keep practicing. You'll get it down. Both bleeds, good basics. If Nex is MDing you, it's worth it to run her to stall autos, but don't worry too much if she does another siphon before you can phase.

Zaros Phase Notes Bleed used first on the minion can be used twice in Zaros (This is why Frag should be first)! Rapid before deadshot. If rapid is on cooldown, try to use it earlier in ice phase. It should be OFF CD. The 5 tick auto is done for the following reasons: \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- It's more damage than using a junk 100% \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- It's less ticks than a junk 100% \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- You could Snipe in the rotation and frag would come off CD on tick, but are hitcapped so snipe will do less damage per tick. If it's low HP you can 5 tick Auto into rapid fire instead of into bleed. Last Thoughts from @!593106625955495947 Practice. It takes a long time to pvm well. If you have questions, ask someone who is better, but try to figure it out first. If you lack gear, skill, or damage, keep practicing and don't give up. If you're a learner, try to at least understand what's going on, even if not everything makes sense. These abilities will not always be the ones used, as not every kill goes as planned.

When Nex spawns for the first time in a custom instance it will be praying against mage for the majority of the kill, this is why range only kills are the meta for fast consistent kills. After every kill you will teleport out of the instance and re-enter in order to force Nex to always be praying mage. Nex is a 1x1 NPC and posses very strict softcaps, which mean that any damage over a certain amount is reduced by X% depending on the phase. During the first four phases, Nex has a soft cap that reduces excess damage above 5,000 by 50% . For example, a 6,000 damage hit would be reduced to 5,500 damage. On the Zaros phase, the soft cap is changed to reduce excess damage above 2,000 by 75% . This means a 6,000-damage hit would be reduced to 3,000. Nex's mages have a soft cap that reduces excess damage above 1,000 by a random amount between approximately 80% and 100%. Each mage is combat level 111 with 10,000 health, possesses a max hit of around 850, and are weak to bolts. The mages are static and can only be attacked whenever Nex calls their name. An unusual trait they all share is that they are immune to magic attacks. Cruor's attacks always have 100% accuracy and will heal him for 100 damage regardless of the damage he deals, while Glacies' attacks can freeze players if they aren't using Protect/Deflect Magic; keeping the prayer active will result in all of her attacks missing regardless of the player's armour rating.

She is located just west of Port Sarim in the grotworm cave. Located on the third floor down, Queen Black Dragon is a really good boss to prepare for mechanics found in high tier bosses like Araxxor and Telos. While frustrating at first, this boss is a very good example of the value of practice in RS3 PvM. It is highly recommended to have 80 in your preferred combat stat (generally or ), 85 Herblore for Super-Antifires, as well as the Song of the Depths quest completed to reduce the amount of damage received. There are four phases to the Queen Black Dragons fight. Each phase can include all the previous phases' mechanics. Drops \u2b25 \u200e \u200e Royal crossbow piece 1/6 \u2b25 \u200e \u200e QBD Scale 1/2500 (500 threshold) Presets Dragonbane bolts for Hardened Carapace Special.

The melee weapons are used to to activate pillars and the godbook is only used for its passive stats. Make sure to use the dragon slayer perk on your armour and the ability every other kill. It is recommended to use a / at the start of every kill and try to finish every kill at 100% adren. Use dark bow autos at the start of every phase and on the third phase. Note: You can downgrade or upgrade what you have to in order to meet your skill level and budget. You can comfortably do the boss with chaotic crossbows or a royal crossbow. Phases Phase 1: Only Mechanics are her and attacks and the occasional fire wall. The chatbox will say \"The Queen Black Dragon takes a huge breath.\" prior to her fire wall special attack. If the fire wall hits your character, your character will take 750 typeless damage for each tick (generally two ticks) it hits you. If you choose to walk through it, you only take one tick of damage and because of this, it is recommended to walk through the firewall. However, with each firewall, there is a gap where you can stand and not take any damage. The gap will either be on the \u200e \u200e5th square, 9th square (one left of the center artifact) or the 15th square. The phase can be ended by damaging her 25000 amount of damage and activating the pillar. The QBD will spit out grotworms until you activate the artifact. Phase 2: QBD will do her previous mechanics, including the firewall and regular attacks. However, with each phase her fire wall gets stronger. In Phase 1, the firewall will have 1 wall you have to pass through. On Phase 2, it will have two walls. On Phase 3, three walls, and so on. The new mechanic in this phase is the Tortured Souls Mechanic. In the chatbox, the message \"The Queen Black Dragon summons one of her captured souls.\" This mechanic causes a tortured soul to appear and release a cloud that deals 900 damage to the player unless it hits a tortured soul or grotworm first. One way to deal with this mechanic is to learn how to time the cloud correctly and walk over the tortured soul, causing it to deal 900 damage to the soul instead of you. Phase 3: QBD will have four walls this phase. Her Tortured Soul Special will now summon two tortured souls instead of one. One soul will spawn on each side of the player, so in order to avoid getting damaged, move over one when the text appears above their head. In addition two the two tortured souls, any souls in the arena can be used to heal the QBD . The chatbox will say \"The Queen Black Dragon starts to siphon the energy of her mages.\" and will heal her 200 each tick from each tortured soul. Her final possible special on phase 3 is her Crystal Form/Hardened Carapace special. The Queen Black Dragon takes on the consistency of crystal; she is more resistant to magic, but weaker to physical damage. means she will take 25% less damage and 25% more and damage. The Queen Black Dragon hardens her carapace; she is more resistant to physical damage, but more vulnerable to magic. means she will take 25% less damage from and but 25% more damage. Phase 4: In addition to the four firewalls and four tortured souls (one on each diagonal from the character), this phase only has two new mechanics. The first new mechanic is called the Time Stop special. A soul will appear in one of the far corners of the arena saying all three of the following, \"Time is short!\" \"She is pouring her energy into me...hurry!\" \"The spell is nearly complete!\" You must kill the tortured soul or QBD before \u200e \u200ethe tortured soul says all three. If the tortured soul gets to the final dialogue, a few seconds later you will be frozen for a few seconds, unable to move, eat, or do anything until the special is over. \u200e \u200eThis can be very deadly if paired with a tortured soul special or the QBD's final special attack, the Extreme Dragon Breath. \u200e \u200eThe Extreme Dragon Breath ability does high hitting damage if not avoided correctly and is prompted when the chat box says, \"The Queen Black Dragon gathers her strength to breathe extremely hot flames.\". This also is the special to brand the Royal Crossbow. It is recommended to stand on the far right side of the arena in order to avoid as much of the attack as possible. If you stand in the center of the arena, you will take over twice the amount of damage as the side.

The Temple of Aminishi is located on the island of Aminishi and only requires completion of Impressing the Locals to access. The grouping system is required in order to form a team of 2-3 players.

In general fast melee ED1 runs are determined by your ability to maximize the effectiveness of your AoE damage by positioning the enemy NPCs and yourself optimally, along with your ability to output large amounts of high single-target damage during bossfights. Once learned and mastered, running this dungeon can provide large amounts of gp/hour, making it an immensely rewarding experience. GENERAL TIPS Keep track of the HP of all the important(barrier-unlocking) NPCs as well as possible. This helps prevent wasteful usage of abilities. As quite a number of mobs in this dungeon can stun you, incorporating freedom oh+2h autoattack into your rotation is useful for saving time. The Corbicula Rex perk in ROoT is extremely powerful in this dungeon, as Meteor Strike gets used frequently here. If you have the requirements for this perk, it should be active when running ED1. \ud83d\udd34 indicates the route taken \ud83d\udd35 indicates what monsters should be killed If not circled in blue, ignore Section 1 Melee Start with 100% adrenaline from the PvM hub.

If done just in time then sotapanna #1 will be middle target for , #2 if late. If lured correctly, they should stand like this: https://i.imgur.com/4J70MjN.png While waiting, use on any sotapanna (ideally with target cycle to avoid moving in case of missclick) then \u2192 q on middle sotapanna. Target cycle+basic to check whether any of them survived.

Section 3 Melee Room 1 - Head to the barrier on the bridge southeast of the room's entrance. As you will likely be on low adrenaline for this room, use mostly basics to kill 2x Cloaked Zealot. You should also drop 2 here. You want to be on high adrenaline when starting the next room. Be wary of your HP as the room contains a Hanto Sellsword, which can deal heavy damage.

Kill the 6 afromentioned enemies with AoEs. Be wary of the Hanto sellswords in the room. If you are low on food and HP, an alternative, safer method to clear this room is to kill the 2x Elite Sotapanna in room 1, then kill the 2x Eastern Mercenary before you + northwest and kill the 4x Renegade Menaphite soldier. This lets you avoid getting attacked by the dangerous Hanto sellswords.

Sanctum Guardian The first boss of the Temple of Aminishi follows a straightforward attack pattern containing highly damaging attacks which are capable of KOing someone unprepared. Once learned, this boss will essentially become a DPS dummy in where your killtime is reflective of your capability to deal raw damage. Stand to the north of the boss and DPS. Meleers should stand south, otherwise AoEs will not work ( , , ) Attacks: The fight starts with 4x Ranged autoattack, then continues with the following attack pattern: Water burst \u2192 Ranged auto \u2192 Water jet \u2192 Ranged auto \u2192 Purple smoke \u2192 Autoattack* \u2192 repeat. After the 4th water jet attack, 2 Crassian reinforcements are summoned. They deal negligable Ranged damage and generally should not be seen as the boss should be dead before this point anyway. Ranged autoattacks are a projectile that target the spot the player is standing on and hit everyone in a 3x3 area centred around that spot. Due to this along with the travel time this attack takes to hit, it is possible to dodge every Ranged autoattack thrown simply by moving far enough before the attack lands. This is normally not necessary, however. *The autoattack that comes after the Purple smoke special attack can either be a melee autoattack or a ranged autoattack. Turn on Melee prayer for this part and switch to Ranged prayer during the attacks travel time if necessary. The water burst attack is simply a high-hitting melee attack. Melee prayer should be sufficient for dealing with this mechanic. Although slower, it is also possible to avoid this attack completely by moving far away from the boss at the right time, should you wish to do so. Example clip of avoiding the water burst attack: https://streamable.com/g0ffps For experienced players, this is not necessary or worthwhile, as you will be able to heal back any necessary HP with SS flicking. The water jet attack is a beam of water that rotates around the arena once, starting from north and rotating counter-clockwise. Should you get hit by this attack, it will deal ~6000 soft typeless damage. This attack can be dealt with in several ways, such as dodging with Bladed Dive or blocking with Disruption shield or Resonance. Example clip of how to avoid the water jet with <img title=\"bd\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\"bd\" src=\"https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/535532854281764884.png?v=1\">: https://streamable.com/bj1ee1 During this attack, the boss will face north, so you will be able to use Flanking here. Purple smoke is the most dangerous attack of the boss. You will get a blue bar above your character which drains. When the bar is empty, a cloud of purple smoke will cover a 5x5 area centred around your location. After a moment, this smoke cloud will hit players standing in it for rapid soft typeless damage (~4000 per tick), which will lead to a very quick death. Because of this, the purple smokes should be placed in a manner that they will not be in your way for the rest of the bossfight. It is recommended to use Escape at the correct time to place purple smokes next to the southern wall. If doing this multiple times, be careful to not Escape into a smoke you've placed previously. Example of smoke placement: https://streamable.com/ioza4r Melee Rotation: Start with + \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 (bled) \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 188s. Build with basics and use your while keeping track of boss HP and your adrenaline. Ideally you will get the boss's HP low enough to comfortably finish him off within your 2nd . Pay attention to both adrenaline gained and damage dealt, and decide on which abilities to use accordingly. Do not use here as should you use your 2nd quickly, will not be off cooldown when needed. Once you have 100% adrenaline after lowering the boss HP, \u2192 \u2192 188 \u2192 188 \u2192 + \u2192 188 \u2192 2-hit \u2192 \u2192 basics until the boss is dead.

Masuta, the Ascended Masuta, the second boss of the dungeon, keeps true to the dungeon's theme of heavy damage dealt and high KO potential. Using a variety of hard-hitting mechanics and boasting attacks from all three combat styles, Masuta is a noticeable difficulty spike up from the first boss. Phase 1: Autoattacks \u2192 Hurricane \u2192 Autoattacks \u2192 Tsunami \u2192 repeat. Masuta's autoattacks on phase 1 are mostly Melee-based. Although he can also use Ranged instead, this is uncommon. The number of autoattacks he does between each special attack can vary, meaning that the time it takes for him to use his special attacks also varies. Additionally, along with his autoattacks Masuta has a chance to summon an untargetable clone, which will hit you once with Melee before disappearing. Masuta usually starts by doing 4 autoattacks before using Hurricane, however he can use Hurricane earlier (as soon as after 2 autoattacks) or later depending on RNG. Masuta's Hurricane attack lasts for about 12 seconds, hitting nearby players for increasing Melee damage once per tick. Masuta will chase after you at walking speed during this attack. The best way to deal with this is + about 1 GCD after the attack starts. This allows you to continue dealing damage in MD and nullifies most of the damage you take. Note that you can flank Masuta from the north side during his Hurricane attack. After the Hurricane, Masuta returns to throwing autoattacks. Alongside one of his autoattacks, usually the 4th, 5th or 6th autoattack, purple waters appear around the arena. The purples water will thrash about while Masuta uses 3 more autoattacks. Right after the 3rd of these autoattacks, Masuta launches his Tsunami towards his target using the purple waters. This attack will hit you with two extremely high (7k+) Magic hits. This can be dealt with by using both Disruption Shield + Resonance after Masuta's 3rd autoattack, or by moving far enough to avoid getting hit. This can be done by either running or Surging away as the autoattack before the Tsunami hits. Surge timing demonstration: https://streamable.com/jeh1z9 Note that if Masuta phases into the flight phase after the purple waters have appeared, Tsunami will still be used even when Masuta stops autoattacking. After Tsunami, for the rest of Phase 1 Masuta will be able to use Pulverise in place of an autoattack. This will hit moderate melee damage, and can either be prayed against or dodged by running 2 tiles away from your location. You have 1 tick to move far enough when the text \"I'll pulverise you!\" appears over Masuta. Masuta will repeat his attack cycle from the beginning with the addition of Pulverise until his HP reaches the phasing point, 275k. Flight phase: Once his HP reaches 275k, Masuta will stop attacking, start levitating and become practically undamageable. This phase lasts for about 90 seconds. 15 Thrashing waters will spawn at random locations in the arena. They have 8000 HP and a very long-ranged Magic autoattack. Kill the waters as soon as they spawn. When a thrashing water dies, if you are within a 2-tile radius (halberd distance) of the water, you will recieve a 5% Calm waters buff that helps with phase 2. Dominion mines will work on the waters - they will deal 1600 damage per mine. You can use Devotion here to reduce damage taken. Before the phase ends, you can use the Dragon Battleaxe special attack to speed up phase 2. Try to be on 100% adrenaline when the flight phase ends. Phase 2: Phase 2 starts when Masuta yells \"These waters will choke you where you stand!\" and returns to the floor from his levitation. In this phase, Masuta will only use Ranged autoattacks and a powerful Magic attack. The Magic attack hits for very high damage, however this is reduced by the amount shown on the Calm waters buff icon obtained during the flight phase - up to 75%. Masuta starts the phase with 2 Ranged autoattacks followed by his Magic attack, after which he will repeatedly do a varying amount of Ranged autoattacks before using another Magic attack. The amount of Ranged attacks done before a Magic attack is 3-6. The magic attack has a travel time based on distance. Due to this, while in MD of the boss, the attack hits you instantly, while Ranged autoattacks take 1 tick to hit you. As Masuta has an attack speed of 4 ticks, by rotating your overhead prayers \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 repeat, you will always be praying correctly against whatever attack is used. Melee Rotation: Phase 1: + \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 If Hurricane starts after 2 autos: Cancel with + / away, stall from out of distance -> run back in and release with . If Hurricane starts later: Build with 188s. When Masuta starts his Hurricane, time appropriately. Build with strong basics until ends, after which use \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 188s until has 6 seconds of cooldown left, after which \u2192 \u2192 . Finish the phase with strong basics. Remember to manage Masuta's Tsunami properly, even if it requires early cancellation of channeled abilities. Flight phase: The waters die fairly quickly simply by using strong basics and whatever thresholds you have off cooldown. Be sure to utilise resets when moving from water to water. when ~70 seconds of the flight phase have passed, then build to 100% adrenaline with basics. It is recommended (though not necessary) to kill off any remaining waters before moving onto Masuta when phase 2 starts. Phase 2: + \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 build with basics until ends \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 build with basics and use strong thresholds. Masuta should die here. Note: don't use during phase 2, as it should be saved for Seiryu. Ranged Rotation It is recommended to take as much food as you can ( / because with how much you have to eat you would lose too much adrenaline/ brew down too much with solids/ sara brews) and because of this it's recommended to have a separate preset for masuta as banking would lose more time than you would save on a faster kill. Preset example: https://i.imgur.com/KMBXcjN.png After banking step east so you are looking into masutas arena, use defensive and + onto stairs to masuta. Entire p1 should be ruby camp and equip hydrix for 2 abilities after ruby proc. Phase 1: Target cycle (tc is used to avoid missclicks) + \u2192 \u2192 4t auto \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 q \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 + auto> \u2192 q \u2192 4t \u2192 auto \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 (use basics if low adren and asap). Improvise till phased (can use to dump w/e thresholds are left because masuta doesn't always phase immediately once he reaches his threshold hp). Throw once masuta becomes invulnerable. Note the time u phased on and add 1min20s to it (this will be when you use on geysers) Surge away when masuta starts his spin spec and keep kiting until your runs out (should be at in your rotation). Eat to full while kiting. If masuta does late spin, use / to get far enough away to not have to leave your . Geysers: Camp onyx bolts; use / in downtime; Try to directly into geysers so when you kill them, your comes off cooldown; Try to md geysers when you're killing them to gain damage reduction from masutas mage attack; Stack 2 more for a total of 3 stacks; on p1 phase time+ 1min20s and equip hydrix bolts. If last geyser spawns far enough so you can attack masuta without it attacking you then you can ignore it, otherwise make sure to kill it. Phase 2: \u200e \u200e(camp ruby and switch to hydric for 2 abils after proc until ~130k \u200e \u200ehp, camp hydrix after that) \u2192 auto + \u2192 \u2192 q \u2192 4t \u2192 auto \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 q + when it comes off cooldown> \u2192 (skip for basic if low adren)> improvise basics till ends \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 improvise basics> \u2192 \u2192 improvise till finished. Seiryu, the Azure Serpent To finish the dungeon, you need to free Seiryu by destroying the three black crystals on his shackles. This fight will challenge a player's ability to utilise the space they have in the arena to avoid a series of area-based mechanics. Mechanics: This fight is split into 2 phases: the face phase, where the goal is to reduce Seiryu's HP from 7.5M to 7.2M, and the crystal phase, where you have limited time to damage the black crystals. You will only be attacked during the face phase of the fight. Throughout the fight Seiryu's basic attack will either be a Magic autoattack, or Seiryu will use his tail to summon a shadow that deals rapid damage under the player. You can heal back HP lost from Magic autoattacks using SS flicking easily due to Seiryu's slow attack speed. Summoned shadows will cover a 2x2 area where the targeted tile you were on is the north-eastern tile of the area. The shadow deals rapid damage (~2k per tick) to anyone standing within the area and lasts for about 10 seconds before disappearing. This can be dealt with by simply moving out of the shadow. Seiryu starts the fight by using 4 attacks, after which his attack rotation is as follows: Huge breath \u2192 2 attacks \u2192 Shadow energy* \u2192 2 attacks \u2192 repeat *The 2nd Shadow energy attack will be replaced by the Black hands mechanic. When the huge breath attack starts, the game message \"Seiryu takes a huge breath\" will appear on your screen. This attack is an accurate, high-damaging (~8k) Magic attack. You can dodge this attack by standing within 3 tiles of the southern edge of the arena, you can block it with Disruption shield/Resonance or you can simply tank it. When Seiryu's shadow energy attack starts, the game message \"Shadow energy bursts forth from Seiryu.\" appears, and arrows will appear under your character, on the arena and on your minimap pointing to a specific tile. Seiryu will launch a shadow projectile towards this specific tile. Once the shadow projectile lands, highly damaging black hands will move from the marked tile towards your current location. Be sure to dodge these hands by sidestepping out of their path. Seiryu's 2nd shadow energy attack is replaced by a series of black hands that spawn from the southern edge of the arena. These hands deal extremely high damage, so be sure to avoid these. They will spawn from a random point and move north, with the spawn point moving both east and west, making the hands form a V-shape. Once this attack has been cast, a new formation of black hands will always spawn when the current formation of black hands is complete. Be wary of where the hands start spawning each time as if they spawn near you, it is easy to be KO'd very quickly. Once the crystal phase starts, the arena is cleared of black hands and shadows and Seiryu stops attacking you. After the crystal phase ends, Seiryu will continue his basic attacks from where he left off, however his first special attack will always be his huge breath attack. For example, if Seiryu used his huge breath followed by 1 basic attack before the crystal phase started, he will continue with 1 basic attack, followed by his huge breath attack. During the crystal phase, you will be able to jump onto Seiryu's shackles and start damaging the crystals. Soon after, a set of 6 shadow enigmas will spawn in the arena and head towards Seiryu. When an enigma reaches him, it will cause every crystal that hasn't been destroyed to heal by 50k HP. You should ignore the first set of enigmas and DPS the crystals - you have roughly 1 minute until the first heal is activated, and after the 6th heal is finished, you have another 13.2 seconds before you get stunned and teleported back down and the fight returns back to the face phase. A second set of enigmas will have spawned by now, so deal with them before going back to attacking Seiryu. Rotation: Notes for 2 cycle seiryu: 1 cycle is consistent and doable faster, but 2 cycling is far easier. Any familiar larger than 1x1, such as Ripper Demons and Steel Titans, will not be able to directly attack the crystals. Keep in mind that you can Flank Seiryu from the south edge of the arena. You will not be attacked at all while on Seiryu's shackle, so avoiding healing to make the most out of your Berserker's Fury relic is advisable. Melee: Start the fight with a \u2192 \u2192 188 \u2192 188 \u2192 + -> \u2192 build with strong basics until Zerk ends \u2192 \u2192 . Optimally when Seiryu reaches 7.2M HP, you will have 100% adrenaline ready for the crystal phase. With this in mind, decide on which/how many thresholds to use depending on how much damage you've dealt to the boss. If your damage output is high, prioritise to ensure is off cooldown for the crystal phase. When Seiryu phases at 7.2M HP, swiftly move to either side's jump spot (marked here: https://i.imgur.com/hcc69l5.png ) and click the jump option on the shackle platform. After the climbing animation: + \u2192 + drop \u2192 thresholds+basics until the first crystal is dead. Before the wave of heals reaches the crystals, be sure to have used a fully channeled twice and to be on 100% adrenaline. before the first enigma reaches Seiryu and build to 100%, then, either 1 or 2 ticks after the first Uber heal hitsplat appears: \u2192 \u2192 2x Defensive(not ) \u2192 + drop \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 3 hit \u2192 \u2192 . (Example clip: https://streamable.com/h2y1qo ) You will be teleported down after . If the second crystal was destroyed, you can ignore the enigmas and attack Seiryu: \u2192 basics \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 build to 100%. If not, with your Caroming switch on the 3rd or 4th enigma to make all of them attack you. Move up to Seiryu and \u2192 basics until the enigmas are gathered around you \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 build to 100%. After reaching 100%, \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 188 \u2192 + \u2192 \u2192 build to 50% \u2192 \u2192 strong abilities until Seiryu is phased. You will not have available immediately for the second crystal phase. If the second crystal was not destroyed, jump up from the same side as you did earlier and use whatever abilities you deem necessary to finish it off. Ideally, when the second crystal is destroyed, you have 100% adrenaline and both and off cooldown. For the final crystal, + \u2192 + Drop \u2192 188s and thresholds until the third crystal is destroyed.

In general fast melee ED1 runs are determined by your ability to maximize the effectiveness of your AoE damage by positioning the enemy NPCs and yourself optimally, along with your ability to output large amounts of high single-target damage during bossfights. Once learned and mastered, running this dungeon can provide large amounts of gp/hour, making it an immensely rewarding experience. GENERAL TIPS Keep track of the HP of all the important(barrier-unlocking) NPCs as well as possible. This helps prevent wasteful usage of abilities. As quite a number of mobs in this dungeon can stun you, incorporating freedom oh+2h autoattack into your rotation is useful for saving time. The Corbicula Rex perk in ROoT is extremely powerful in this dungeon, as Meteor Strike gets used frequently here.

Once learned, this boss will essentially become a DPS dummy in where your killtime is reflective of your capability to deal raw damage. Stand to the north of the boss and DPS. Meleers should stand south, otherwise AoEs will not work ( , , ) Attacks: The fight starts with 4x Ranged autoattack, then continues with the following attack pattern: Water burst \u2192 Ranged auto \u2192 Water jet \u2192 Ranged auto \u2192 Purple smoke \u2192 Autoattack* \u2192 repeat. After the 4th water jet attack, 2 Crassian reinforcements are summoned. They deal negligable Ranged damage and generally should not be seen as the boss should be dead before this point anyway. Ranged autoattacks are a projectile that target the spot the player is standing on and hit everyone in a 3x3 area centred around that spot. Due to this along with the travel time this attack takes to hit, it is possible to dodge every Ranged autoattack thrown simply by moving far enough before the attack lands. This is normally not necessary, however. *The autoattack that comes after the Purple smoke special attack can either be a melee autoattack or a ranged autoattack. Turn on Melee prayer for this part and switch to Ranged prayer during the attacks travel time if necessary. The water burst attack is simply a high-hitting melee attack. Melee prayer should be sufficient for dealing with this mechanic. Although slower, it is also possible to avoid this attack completely by moving far away from the boss at the right time, should you wish to do so. Example clip of avoiding the water burst attack: https://streamable.com/g0ffps For experienced players, this is not necessary or worthwhile, as you will be able to heal back any necessary HP with SS flicking. The water jet attack is a beam of water that rotates around the arena once, starting from north and rotating counter-clockwise. Should you get hit by this attack, it will deal ~6000 soft typeless damage. This attack can be dealt with in several ways, such as dodging with Bladed Dive or blocking with Disruption shield or Resonance. Example clip of how to avoid the water jet with <img title=\"bd\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\"bd\" src=\"https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/535532854281764884.png?v=1\">: https://streamable.com/bj1ee1 During this attack, the boss will face north, so you will be able to use Flanking here. Purple smoke is the most dangerous attack of the boss. You will get a blue bar above your character which drains. When the bar is empty, a cloud of purple smoke will cover a 5x5 area centred around your location. After a moment, this smoke cloud will hit players standing in it for rapid soft typeless damage (~4000 per tick), which will lead to a very quick death. Because of this, the purple smokes should be placed in a manner that they will not be in your way for the rest of the bossfight. It is recommended to use Escape at the correct time to place purple smokes next to the southern wall. If doing this multiple times, be careful to not Escape into a smoke you've placed previously. Example of smoke placement: https://streamable.com/ioza4r Melee Rotation: Start with + \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 (bled) \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 188s.

Using a variety of hard-hitting mechanics and boasting attacks from all three combat styles, Masuta is a noticeable difficulty spike up from the first boss. Phase 1: Autoattacks \u2192 Hurricane \u2192 Autoattacks \u2192 Tsunami \u2192 repeat. Masuta's autoattacks on phase 1 are mostly Melee-based. Although he can also use Ranged instead, this is uncommon. The number of autoattacks he does between each special attack can vary, meaning that the time it takes for him to use his special attacks also varies. Additionally, along with his autoattacks Masuta has a chance to summon an untargetable clone, which will hit you once with Melee before disappearing. Masuta usually starts by doing 4 autoattacks before using Hurricane, however he can use Hurricane earlier (as soon as after 2 autoattacks) or later depending on RNG. Masuta's Hurricane attack lasts for about 12 seconds, hitting nearby players for increasing Melee damage once per tick. Masuta will chase after you at walking speed during this attack. The best way to deal with this is + about 1 GCD after the attack starts. This allows you to continue dealing damage in MD and nullifies most of the damage you take. Note that you can flank Masuta from the north side during his Hurricane attack. After the Hurricane, Masuta returns to throwing autoattacks. Alongside one of his autoattacks, usually the 4th, 5th or 6th autoattack, purple waters appear around the arena. The purples water will thrash about while Masuta uses 3 more autoattacks. Right after the 3rd of these autoattacks, Masuta launches his Tsunami towards his target using the purple waters. This attack will hit you with two extremely high (7k+) Magic hits. This can be dealt with by using both Disruption Shield + Resonance after Masuta's 3rd autoattack, or by moving far enough to avoid getting hit. This can be done by either running or Surging away as the autoattack before the Tsunami hits. Surge timing demonstration: https://streamable.com/jeh1z9 Note that if Masuta phases into the flight phase after the purple waters have appeared, Tsunami will still be used even when Masuta stops autoattacking. After Tsunami, for the rest of Phase 1 Masuta will be able to use Pulverise in place of an autoattack. This will hit moderate melee damage, and can either be prayed against or dodged by running 2 tiles away from your location. You have 1 tick to move far enough when the text \"I'll pulverise you!\" appears over Masuta. Masuta will repeat his attack cycle from the beginning with the addition of Pulverise until his HP reaches the phasing point, 275k. Flight phase: Once his HP reaches 275k, Masuta will stop attacking, start levitating and become practically undamageable. This phase lasts for about 90 seconds. 15 Thrashing waters will spawn at random locations in the arena. They have 8000 HP and a very long-ranged Magic autoattack. Kill the waters as soon as they spawn. When a thrashing water dies, if you are within a 2-tile radius (halberd distance) of the water, you will recieve a 5% Calm waters buff that helps with phase 2. Dominion mines will work on the waters - they will deal 1600 damage per mine. You can use Devotion here to reduce damage taken. Before the phase ends, you can use the Dragon Battleaxe special attack to speed up phase 2. Try to be on 100% adrenaline when the flight phase ends. Phase 2: Phase 2 starts when Masuta yells \"These waters will choke you where you stand!\" and returns to the floor from his levitation. In this phase, Masuta will only use Ranged autoattacks and a powerful Magic attack. The Magic attack hits for very high damage, however this is reduced by the amount shown on the Calm waters buff icon obtained during the flight phase - up to 75%. Masuta starts the phase with 2 Ranged autoattacks followed by his Magic attack, after which he will repeatedly do a varying amount of Ranged autoattacks before using another Magic attack. The amount of Ranged attacks done before a Magic attack is 3-6. The magic attack has a travel time based on distance. Due to this, while in MD of the boss, the attack hits you instantly, while Ranged autoattacks take 1 tick to hit you. As Masuta has an attack speed of 4 ticks, by rotating your overhead prayers \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 repeat, you will always be praying correctly against whatever attack is used. Melee Rotation: Phase 1: + \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 If Hurricane starts after 2 autos: Cancel with + / away, stall from out of distance -> run back in and release with . If Hurricane starts later: Build with 188s. When Masuta starts his Hurricane, time appropriately. Build with strong basics until ends, after which use \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 188s until has 6 seconds of cooldown left, after which \u2192 \u2192 . Finish the phase with strong basics. Remember to manage Masuta's Tsunami properly, even if it requires early cancellation of channeled abilities. Flight phase: The waters die fairly quickly simply by using strong basics and whatever thresholds you have off cooldown. Be sure to utilise resets when moving from water to water. when ~70 seconds of the flight phase have passed, then build to 100% adrenaline with basics. It is recommended (though not necessary) to kill off any remaining waters before moving onto Masuta when phase 2 starts. Phase 2: + \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 build with basics until ends \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 build with basics and use strong thresholds. Masuta should die here. Note: don't use during phase 2, as it should be saved for Seiryu. Ranged Rotation It is recommended to take as much food as you can ( / because with how much you have to eat you would lose too much adrenaline/ brew down too much with solids/ sara brews) and because of this it's recommended to have a separate preset for masuta as banking would lose more time than you would save on a faster kill.

This fight will challenge a player's ability to utilise the space they have in the arena to avoid a series of area-based mechanics. Mechanics: This fight is split into 2 phases: the face phase, where the goal is to reduce Seiryu's HP from 7.5M to 7.2M, and the crystal phase, where you have limited time to damage the black crystals. You will only be attacked during the face phase of the fight. Throughout the fight Seiryu's basic attack will either be a Magic autoattack, or Seiryu will use his tail to summon a shadow that deals rapid damage under the player. You can heal back HP lost from Magic autoattacks using SS flicking easily due to Seiryu's slow attack speed. Summoned shadows will cover a 2x2 area where the targeted tile you were on is the north-eastern tile of the area. The shadow deals rapid damage (~2k per tick) to anyone standing within the area and lasts for about 10 seconds before disappearing. This can be dealt with by simply moving out of the shadow. Seiryu starts the fight by using 4 attacks, after which his attack rotation is as follows: Huge breath \u2192 2 attacks \u2192 Shadow energy* \u2192 2 attacks \u2192 repeat *The 2nd Shadow energy attack will be replaced by the Black hands mechanic. When the huge breath attack starts, the game message \"Seiryu takes a huge breath\" will appear on your screen. This attack is an accurate, high-damaging (~8k) Magic attack. You can dodge this attack by standing within 3 tiles of the southern edge of the arena, you can block it with Disruption shield/Resonance or you can simply tank it. When Seiryu's shadow energy attack starts, the game message \"Shadow energy bursts forth from Seiryu.\" appears, and arrows will appear under your character, on the arena and on your minimap pointing to a specific tile. Seiryu will launch a shadow projectile towards this specific tile. Once the shadow projectile lands, highly damaging black hands will move from the marked tile towards your current location. Be sure to dodge these hands by sidestepping out of their path. Seiryu's 2nd shadow energy attack is replaced by a series of black hands that spawn from the southern edge of the arena. These hands deal extremely high damage, so be sure to avoid these. They will spawn from a random point and move north, with the spawn point moving both east and west, making the hands form a V-shape. Once this attack has been cast, a new formation of black hands will always spawn when the current formation of black hands is complete. Be wary of where the hands start spawning each time as if they spawn near you, it is easy to be KO'd very quickly. Once the crystal phase starts, the arena is cleared of black hands and shadows and Seiryu stops attacking you. After the crystal phase ends, Seiryu will continue his basic attacks from where he left off, however his first special attack will always be his huge breath attack. For example, if Seiryu used his huge breath followed by 1 basic attack before the crystal phase started, he will continue with 1 basic attack, followed by his huge breath attack. During the crystal phase, you will be able to jump onto Seiryu's shackles and start damaging the crystals. Soon after, a set of 6 shadow enigmas will spawn in the arena and head towards Seiryu. When an enigma reaches him, it will cause every crystal that hasn't been destroyed to heal by 50k HP. You should ignore the first set of enigmas and DPS the crystals - you have roughly 1 minute until the first heal is activated, and after the 6th heal is finished, you have another 13.2 seconds before you get stunned and teleported back down and the fight returns back to the face phase. A second set of enigmas will have spawned by now, so deal with them before going back to attacking Seiryu. Rotation: Notes for 2 cycle seiryu: 1 cycle is consistent and doable faster, but 2 cycling is far easier. Any familiar larger than 1x1, such as Ripper Demons and Steel Titans, will not be able to directly attack the crystals. Keep in mind that you can Flank Seiryu from the south edge of the arena. You will not be attacked at all while on Seiryu's shackle, so avoiding healing to make the most out of your Berserker's Fury relic is advisable. Melee: Start the fight with a \u2192 \u2192 188 \u2192 188 \u2192 + -> \u2192 build with strong basics until Zerk ends \u2192 \u2192 . Optimally when Seiryu reaches 7.2M HP, you will have 100% adrenaline ready for the crystal phase. With this in mind, decide on which/how many thresholds to use depending on how much damage you've dealt to the boss. If your damage output is high, prioritise to ensure is off cooldown for the crystal phase. When Seiryu phases at 7.2M HP, swiftly move to either side's jump spot (marked here: https://i.imgur.com/hcc69l5.png ) and click the jump option on the shackle platform. After the climbing animation: + \u2192 + drop \u2192 thresholds+basics until the first crystal is dead. Before the wave of heals reaches the crystals, be sure to have used a fully channeled twice and to be on 100% adrenaline. before the first enigma reaches Seiryu and build to 100%, then, either 1 or 2 ticks after the first Uber heal hitsplat appears: \u2192 \u2192 2x Defensive(not ) \u2192 + drop \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 3 hit \u2192 \u2192 . (Example clip: https://streamable.com/h2y1qo ) You will be teleported down after . If the second crystal was destroyed, you can ignore the enigmas and attack Seiryu: \u2192 basics \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 build to 100%. If not, with your Caroming switch on the 3rd or 4th enigma to make all of them attack you. Move up to Seiryu and \u2192 basics until the enigmas are gathered around you \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 build to 100%. After reaching 100%, \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 188 \u2192 + \u2192 \u2192 build to 50% \u2192 \u2192 strong abilities until Seiryu is phased. You will not have available immediately for the second crystal phase. If the second crystal was not destroyed, jump up from the same side as you did earlier and use whatever abilities you deem necessary to finish it off. Ideally, when the second crystal is destroyed, you have 100% adrenaline and both and off cooldown. For the final crystal, + \u2192 + Drop \u2192 188s and thresholds until the third crystal is destroyed.

Move to the spot two squares north of the other scout and Hurricane, hitting all four enemies. Finish off with Cleave and Quake. Room 2: If using mage run behind the 3 Scouts and detonate. The scuttlers will md you by the time it's charged, If using melee use Flurry on the scouts, hitting as much scuttlers and scouts as possible. Finish with Cleave and Hurricane. Room 3: If you're on ancients, you can ice barrage the line of Warriors and all the mobs in this room will be lined up for tsunami and dragonbreath. With melee, move to the center of the cluster and Meteor Strike. Cleave and Quake should finish the job afterwards Easy video guide: https://youtu.be/bETOKmCEv6I Room 4: There's only two Cloaked Zealots to clear here and they're lined up for AoEs so just do whatever you want here, dragonbreath, chain, deto if you want to, etc. If melee just use Hurricane, Flurry, and Quake on the zealots to kill them. Room 5: There are two Crassian Scouts and two Cloaked Zealots spaced apart here. Aggro the zealots and move back a few steps to stack the mobs together for AoEs. Detonate may be used but is likely better for the next room. For melee line up your Cleave, Hurricane, and Quake to hit everything in one go. You only need to kill the two scouts and zealots to move to the next room. Example: https://youtu.be/VYA1tj-7dqg Room 6: This room has two groups of zombies. The first set will stack into your deto if you charge it near the entrance rather than surging past them. You don't want to draw aggro from the second group early as that splits them up and makes them harder to AoE. Most if not all of the second group is quickly lurable into a tsunami. For melee, hit the first group with Cleave then keep running past while putting on your salve amulet. Quake the second group, then run back to the middle to lure both groups of zombies next to you. Hurricane and finish off the rest with Bladed Dive (with laceration boots) and Flurry. If you have it available, Meteor Strike is good but you likely won\u2019t have it back in time. Activate Undead Slayer to speed up the process as well. Room 7: Fairly small room, use detonate once all the npcs are md for mage. For melee, barge a zombie, Cleave, then target the 20k armored zombie and bleed Assault on it. Then run back to the zombie you used Barge on and AoE with Hurricane and other AoE abilities. Another easy video guide: https://youtu.be/h4Y3gEqJ6rg Room 8: You only need to kill the two zealots here to proceed. Kill the zealots with Flurry and Cleave and take off your salve amulet for your main amulet. End with high adrenaline for the first boss, The Crassian Leviathan. Room 9: There is a cloaked zealot and various scuttlers in this room you need to clear to proceed. You can generally stand behind the zealot and the scuttlers will md you for AoEs. Barge one of the scouts for both the Barge buff and faster movement. Bleed Assault on the zealot, then immediately target a scuttler to Hurricane and Quake. Room 10: Put your salve amulet back on. Very spread out zombies in here that are fairly annoying to AoE as mage. Most of the time you can catch most of them in a detonate fairly quickly and then finish off the stragglers with your remaining abilities. After letting them md you use Meteor Strike and a few AoEs. Activate Undead Slayer to speed up the process. Room 11: Run down a long path and jump down the cliff to clear an Ulthven Necromancer and two Huge Skeletons. There's not much to this room but focusing the necromancer will clear the skeletons in the AoE. For melee, target cycle \u2192 Barge \u2192 bleed Assault on one of the skeletons or necromancer, depending on which enemy you tagged with Barge. Finish off the rest with Hurricane and Cleave. Room 12: There are two necromancers off at the sides and a line of three Armoured Zombies that stack up very well for a detonate guarding the door. You only need to kill one necromancer and the zombies to proceed to section 2, the temple area. For melee, kill one of the necromancers with a walked Slaughter \u2192 Dismember \u2192 Decimate. Then quickly move to the zombies guarding the entrance to the temple itself. Cleave and Flurry the zombies, then finish off with random basics. Section 2 Room 1: There are two Ulthven Necromancers guarding the gates to the east and west that you must clear to access the black stone artefacts. The main gate will not drop until these have been activated. A mass of summoned skeletons will form in the room as you go about this task, making it a very easy soul split opportunity with corruption blast before you proceed. Go to either necromancer and Barge (with Mobile) \u2192 Assault. Kill that necromancer and activate the artifact, then go to the other necromancer and Barge (with Mobile again) \u2192 Flurry or Destroy (Destroy might be dicey because of the bridge room but you can do it), then activate the artifact. Room 2: This is the archer bridge where you get pelted with small ranged hits constantly. There are two Sea Horrors and a necromancer at the end of this room that you must clear to proceed. The horrors deal a ton of damage so, as mage, it's important to avoid them by standing away or using ice spells. You'll want to use devotion at some point for obvious reasons and revenge hits 10 stacks immediately here. Focus on dealing damage here and you'll be out very quickly. For melee, Devotion right as you start moving into the bridge and Bladed Dive + Surge to the end immediately mid-GCD, then Barge one of the sea horrors. Bleed Assault on it, then target the necromancer to Hurricane. Cleave and Quake the horror you didn\u2019t attack to kill both the first horror and the necromancer. Finish off the horror with Flurry or other strong basics while you finish off the horror as quickly as possible. A lot of learners panic eat a ton here but the bridge can be done with no food Example: https://youtu.be/I_4wbqXoZaw Room 3: There's a line of three Acolytes of Seiryu guarding the gate here that must be cleared to proceed. They are melee and line up well for AoEs so just go to town here. Room 4: Bladed dive/surge through the staircase as marked to avoid aggroing the four acolytes and go all the way to the next gate. There are many mobs here but only the necromancers and Huge Skeletons must be cleared. For melee start with a Meteor Strike and finish off all the mobs with Quake and other AoE abilities. but make sure to have high adrenaline as the next room is the second boss, Taraket the Necromancer. Room 5: There is a Sea Witch and two Armoured Zombies in this room. Very straightforward, just dps and stack for AoEs as you see fit. Sea Witches have extremely delayed attacks for some reason so you may still take a moderate mage hit several seconds after it has died. Try not to use Assault because you\u2019ll want to save it for the next room, though. Room 6: Only the Kalgerion Demon needs to be killed here to proceed. He's really big and impossible to miss, activate Demon Slayer and Barge \u2192 Assault the Kal\u2019gerion demon. Finish off with more strong basics and thresholds. You can manipulate one of the required necromancers in room 7 to move from his position to make the next room easier on you by running as close as you can to him, so he aggros you through the wall. But this isn\u2019t 100% guaranteed, and if you don\u2019t get it simply skip it and proceed. Room 7: There's two necromancers (marked in red) hiding around in this room that need to be cleared. Just dump some thresholds and proceed. Room 8: Another two necromancers are guarding the gate here so just continue picking them off. The Sea Witches and Magister miniboss that can spawn at the east side of the room have a fairly large aggro range so preferably hug the wall as you enter. For melee, Quake and Decimate the first necromancer immediately. Slaughter and Surge at the exact same time to finish it off and move yourself quickly through the dungeon. Get on the other necromancer and finish it off with Hurricane and other strong basics. Finally, dive into the abyss to enter the final section of the dungeon. Room 1: There is a group of Crassian Warriors and scuttlers around the gate that must be killed. There's a decent amount of damage to do here so sunshine, detonate, etc., are recommended. They stack up very nicely for barrage autos and other AoEs and aren't very threatening in general. For melee, move to the gate and Barge a crassian warrior. Bleed Assault on it, and let the rest of the warriors gather to you, then finish them off with Cleave, Hurricane, and Quake. Save Meteor Strike for Room 3. Room 2: Two Warped Skeletons in here that can completely clear you if you aren't paying attention. If you sunned earlier at the previous gate, you can finish the remaining duration in here. The skeletons can deal a moderate mage hit frequently, healing themselves while dealing 2000-3000 damage to you. It's recommended to keep them snared/stunned to not have to deal with this. Room 3: There are two more Warped Skeletons along with three Cloaked Zealots guarding the gate. Run behind the line of zealots and detonate to clear this room fairly quickly. Once again, be wary of getting cleared by the skeletons but an ice barrage can freeze all the mobs in here nicely. For melee, Meteor Strike and AoE the zealots and skeletons all in one and finish off the rest of the mobs however you see fit. Room 4: The last room before the final boss of the dungeon. There are two more skeletons along with two Crassian Scouts that need to be cleared to proceed. They're pretty spread out so just dps and make sure to be on high adrenaline for the encounter with The Ambassador. There are three minibosses that can spawn in this room with a fairly inconvenient aggro range so avoid them by quickly Bladed Dive + Surging. For melee, Barge the crassian scouts, finish off the rest of the mobs, but try not to use Assault so you can more quickly use it for the start of Ambassador if you don\u2019t want to wait. The Crassian Leviathan As the first boss of The Shadow Reef, The Crassian Leviathan has a very small and easy set of area denial mechanics that can deal a lot of damage if ignored. The boss will also passively heal over the duration of the fight, although the amount is very negligible. Once you get used to the mechanics however, this fight should be extremely consistent and fast. Mechanics Poison pits + Additional heads: The center of the arena is filled with poison and is surrounded by the additional heads of the leviathan. This area deals constant poison damage and makes the player vulnerable to long stun attacks that the heads can use. The player should never stand in this zone during the fight, making this mechanic largely irrelevant. Dragon Breath: This will always be the first mechanic of the fight and is signaled by the leviathan firing a stationary breath attack in front of it, dealing rapid heavy damage. Simply stand off to the side to avoid this. Afterwards, reposition in front of the boss to avoid being caught in the next mechanic. Head Sweep: The leviathan will slam its' head across the ground twice, dealing very heavy damage to anyone caught in the area. This is avoided by moving to the opposite side of where the sweep begins, as seen here (applicable for melee with scythe): https://youtu.be/kOnRdfXKitI After going through one Dragon Breath and two sets of Head Sweeps, the leviathan will shortly move to other opposite side of the arena. Avoid entering the center here by bladed dive and surging across. Any bleed used will be considered walked as this transition occurs. It will then go through the same rotation, starting at Dragon Breath again, so position appropriately. Optimally, this fight can be completed in 90 seconds or less, shortly after the the boss swaps sides. Strategy (Melee only) For melee, you\u2019ll want to just get your Berserk and ZGS spec off. Within your Berserk, bleed Assault, fully channel Destroy, and 3 hit Flurry. Within ZGS, get at least a fully channeled Assault and Destroy off. Don\u2019t bother with a second Berserk, aim to just finish him off in one cycle with just Berserk and ZGS. Taraket the Necromancer This encounter is the second boss of the Shadow Reef, and is a clear step up in difficulty from the first. Taraket's mechanics revolve around spawning large amount of skeletal mobs that can deal heavy damage if ignored. As such, there are a large amount of targets in this fight and AoE abilities can be utilized to their full potential. The player can take a large amount of damage from all three combat styles, and having good DPS is an important factor in making this fight go smoothly. A Salve Amulet (e) should be used for the entire fight as it increases damage output drastically. Mechanics Rift of Undeath: Taraket will spawn a Rift of Undeath with 30,000 HP. This rift will spawn a large amount of ranged and melee skeletons that each deal low amounts of damage. After roughly 30 seconds, it will explode, dealing very heavy damage to the player. As such, it should be dealt with sometime in it's duration, preferably with some AoE abilities as that will clear the skeletons that spawn around it. Death's Swiftness: Taraket will shroud himself in a Death's Swiftness, becoming immobile and switching attack styles from mage to ranged. These autos will deal slightly more damage, especially if the player is maging the boss and therefore has worse ranged defence. This will happen fairly sporadically throughout the fight so just be ready to switch prayers at any point. Corpse Carrier and Bloated Monstrosity: Upon reaching 200,000 hitpoints, Taraket will become invulnerable and fly towards one of the two black crystals at the sides of the arena, healing himself and spawning the Corpse Carrier (west) or the Bloated Monstrosity (east), with 90,000 HP each. The Corpse Carrier will continuously spawn skeletal mobs as it's alive while the Bloated Monstrosity increases the damage of Taraket's attacks. Both of these attack with melee and are very easy to kite if needed. Taraket can only spawn these once each and will not heal upon hitting 200,000 HP afterwards. The first spawn is not random and can be forced by moving Taraket closer to the desired crystal, although he will always go east if he has not been moved. Spirit Line: Taraket will yell out \"Your efforts are meaningless, witness the fury of the dead!\" or \"I am the master of death!\" and summon a line of spirits from a random direction that will move towards the player, dealing rapid 2000+ damage upon contact. This is accompanied by a very strong (5000+) melee hit to anyone standing directly in front of him. Simply move out of the way accordingly when this happens and don't stay in front of the boss after the two crystals have been spawned. Strategy (Mage) Ancients is highly recommended to AoE the various targets down while staying on the boss. Undead Slayer Sigil and Salve Amulet (e) are extremely helpful as well. Start the fight with combust and escape to lure Taraket on top of his portal spawn location. The correct position for the player is roughly 2-3 squares from the wall. DPS the boss to 200,000 HP and the portal should be nearly dead from AoEs. Taraket will then move to spawn the Bloated Monstrosity. He can be kept in the lure spot by repositioning to MD east of him and then moving south 2 ticks after the skybox changes. This is inconsistent if the skeletons from the portal are also MD of him at the time so the boss may need to be relured. Lure example: https://youtu.be/7JGT6zV35CY Re-vuln and charge detonate on the boss. The Bloated Monstrosity should MD and the two can be caught in AoEs until the boss is DPSed back down to 200k. Try to keep the boss in the lure spot again and kill the monstrosity as Taraket is flying to spawn the Corpse Carrier. Lure and AoE the two while focusing on the Corpse Carrier. The skeletons that spawn at this point can be absorbed by the boss to uber heal himself and also add up to a lot of damage taken. DPS the boss down to 200,000 again and he will use Death's Swiftness and then 2x Spirit Wall. Stay MD and walk to the opposite side of the boss to avoid this mechanic. Flanking can be used at this time. Example: https://youtu.be/H7MfqLltWyg After this, the boss can be easily DPSed down to 0. Another rift may be spawned at some point but shouldn't be an issue if the lure has been maintained and/or the boss is low enough HP to ignore it. Strategy (Melee) There are three slightly different methods to this: killing both bloats for maximum safety, killing only the corpse carrier immediately to balance safety with speed, and just DPSing Taraket and tanking both bloats. What you do will slightly affect your rotation, but the overall goals remain the same. No matter how you do the fight, start with Berserk to Barge. Don\u2019t use adrenaline potions immediately as you\u2019d want to save it for later. Instead, just use limitless to get your thresholds off. If you were quick and started the fight while you still have your Meteor Strike buff from the previous room, the amount of adrenaline you will gain from critical hits will let you go bleed Assault -> 3 hit Flurry -> Destroy for the most optimal DPS rotation without an adrenaline potion. Otherwise, just 2 hit Flurry to Destroy. Regardless, dump the rest of your strong basics and the portal should spawn right before Taraket phases. Activate Undead Slayer right when you use your next ability after Assault. Destroy the portal immediately. Abilities like Blood Tendrils are fantastic for this purpose. After that, you can either get back on Taraket (the best way) or kill the bloated monstrosity ASAP (safer but slower). However you choose, use ZGS to either DPS down Taraket or the bloat, then focus on Taraket. If you ZGS Taraket, use Barge as soon as he\u2019s available to be hit with dual wield, then swap to ZGS to spec then to your terrasaur maul to get a lossless 2h auto for high damage. Bleed Assault and try to save Hurricane right before the 200k mark so you can overphase him and get an extra bit of damage before he runs off to heal and spawn the corpse carrier. If you want to kill the corpse carrier instantly, Barge -> Flurry on it, then Slaughter to Meteor Strike as more skeletons spawn from the corpse carrier for maximum adrenaline refunds. Finish it off quickly, then right after it\u2019s dead, use Berserk -> Barge + adrenaline potion -> bleed thresholds and finish Taraket off. Use ZGS spec after your Berserk wears off as well. Activate Undead Slayer with your Berserk as well. If you ignore the corpse carrier, Berserk -> Barge immediately when Taraket can be damaged again and simply outeat everything. This is extremely risky, but can be done fairly well even with blubbers and Guthix rests. As your ZGS spec will still be on cooldown, finish off the rest with strong basics and thresholds. Use Devotion if you really have to, but generally you don\u2019t need it. Deal with the mechanics just as you do with Magic and you\u2019ll be perfectly fine. Kranon, the Ambassador At the bottom of the abyssal section awaits the Ambassador, the final boss of the Elite Dungeon 3. This boss has a moderate learning curve compared to most solo bosses and has a variety of mechanics ranging from DPS checks, area denial, and self-healing, as well as utilizing multiple combat styles. The boss primarily attacks with ranged, with a heavy mage attack after every 5 autos. The mage hit is replaced by a small but instant melee swipe if the player is in melee distance. Mechanics Purple Corruption: The Ambassador fires a spout into the player, dealing no damage and placing a bar over their head. When this bar nears depletion, a 5x5 area around the player will become corrupted until the boss reaches 400,000 hitpoints. This is similar to the Sanctum Guardian's mechanic from ED1 but will create two areas instead, separated by 2 ticks. These zones will last until the final phase of the fight and deal rapid 2000 damage to anyone standing inside. Black Hole: The Ambassador will spawn a black hole around the arena that will explode after a duration, dealing 8000+ damage to the player, this can be despawned by stunning it. Sinister Fragments: Six fragments will disperse from the boss to the edges of the arena with 20,000 HP each. At the same time, the Ambassador will fire three slowly rotating beams that last until the mechanic is over. Simply move between beams while DPSing the fragments down to 0. Dominion mines will deal 4000 damage each but if maging, decent rotations with ice spells and wrack in between abilities is more than sufficient to clear all fragments consistently. Touching the beams is essentially death but, as they always spawn in set locations (N, SE, SW), and rotate counterclockwise slowly, it's very easy to avoid. Crassian Ritual Keepers: Upon hitting 550,000 hitpoints, the Ambassador will begin to spawn Crassian Ritual Keepers that deal low ranged damage and make it harder to resonance his mage autos. These cannot be damaged and will continue to spawn until the boss reaches 400,000 hitpoints, when Seiryu appears at the north side of the arena, heals the player to full HP, and clears all corruption and Ritual Keepers shortly after. The end of this sequence signals the start of the final phase of the boss. Black Hands/Ritual Phase: A ring of black hands will spawn to encompass the edge of the arena. The Ambassador will stop doing his corruption and black hole mechanics and continue his auto attack pattern as normal. The hands will slam down in a clockwise fashion, sending constant smoke projectiles towards the ambassador. These will heal the boss 2500 HP for each smoke let in and can be blocked, directing a small amount of damage towards the player. Allowing the boss to heal makes this phase extremely long so it's important for the player to constantly be moving with the slams. Staying in melee distance of the Ambassador makes this require minimal movement and replaces his mage hits with weaker melee hits. After every 10 autoattacks during this phase, the Ambassador will say \"Fall now and be forgotten,\" sending 5 very heavy mage hits at the player. These can deal 8000+ damage each and must be negated through some defensive usage. However, devotion can only be used on every other instance of this and the smoke from the hands can snipe the player's resonance if they choose to use it. The common strategy for this is to alternate devotion and resonance + reflect or reprisal + reflect. This can still kill the player through 75% damage reduction so make good judgement calls on what to do if not using devotion. Ambassador's attack rotation Mage/Melee auto 5 autos Purple Corruption 5 autos (1 mage, 4 ranged) Black Hole 5 autos (1 ranged, 1 mage, 3 ranged) Purple Corruption 5 autos (2 ranged, 1 mage, 2 ranged) Sinister Fragments Repeat (auto attack pattern resumes, so next would be 3 ranged, 1 mage, 1 ranged) 550,000 HP - Crassian Ritual Keepers/phase 2 400,000 HP - Seiryu spawns Black Hands/Ritual Phase 10 autos Mage Onslaught Repeat Strategy (Mage) Start the fight with a full sunshine rotation and prayer flicking the Ambassador's auto attacks. Place corruption around the boss at the center so they don't interfere with you running around during fragments and stun black holes accordingly. This part is easily doable without using defensives or eating as long as you don't mess up prayers. During fragments, run around between beams spamming ice wrack, bleeds, wild magic, and asphyxiate. Try to end near full adrenaline and charge a detonate on Ambassador if you have extra time remaining. Release detonate and build back to sun (apot should come off cooldown perfectly). Do another full sun rotation and the second set of fragments should be skipped if the player's DPS is good. Otherwise, just keep going until the boss reaches 550k. If health begins to run low, the mage hits can be resonanced or just eat. Using devotion early on during Ritual Keepers allows you to resonance the mage hits risk free and it will come back up in time for mage onslaught later on. Try to not panic eat when the boss is nearing 400k HP as Seiryu will heal you to full. During the final phase, stand melee distance of the boss and start blocking the smokes appropriately, moving slowly clockwise. Don't sun too close to his mage onslaught (10 autos) or you may not have the adrenaline to devotion. The optimal sunshine location is straight on top of the boss as this allows the player to always be in their ultimate as they circle the Ambassador. Continue DPSing and do some combination of reflect, debilitate, resonance, reprisal, etc. on the second mage onslaught. If you're going to resonance, it's recommended to step out of the smoke to prevent it from being sniped. DPS to 0 and the fight is over. Strategy (Melee) Start the fight with a Berserk rotation. By the time you finish, the Ambassador should have laid down his first purple corruption. If you\u2019re not confident in your DPS, you can simply Surge away to place it somewhere else, then Barge back to ZGS spec to bleed Destroy. But if you\u2019re feeling good about your DPS, you can simply place it right next to the Ambassador and run through him to keep DPSing. Either way, lay down your ZGS and dump thresholds. For the black hole, you can choose to either go over to stun, or tank it with Reprisal. With TMW, tanking it and using it as recoil is a very nice source of damage. Do more damage with thresholds until the second corruption. This time, you have to place it away from the Ambassador. If your DPS is good, you should phase either immediately after you get the second corruption or 1-2 autoattacks after. If not, just place the corruption away then get back on Ambassador for a tiny bit before the sinister fragments spawn. Mid-fragments, just use your strong thresholds like Assault, Hurricane, and Blood Tendrils. You can even use Barge to bleed thresholds to wipe them out in essentially 2-3 abilities. Slaughter + Stomp is also a very good combo to wipe out fragments, especially with the masterwork spear of annihilation. If you\u2019re extremely struggling with fragments, Berserk for the first few spinners is an option, but it\u2019s not very efficient nor that much more effective over just thresholds and strong basics. If you want to min-max DPS against Ambassador, use dragon battleaxe after a Hurricane + 188% ability on the third fragment. Once you get back to 100% adrenaline, use Natural Instinct and build back to 100% adrenaline. By that point, the Ambassador should finish his spinning and be able to be damaged again with another Berserk rotation. Keep in mind that during this time, you can essentially only use basics so destroying all of the fragments is made much harder. You only need to kill 5 out of 6 and then use either Resonance or Disruption Shield (most preferred) to block the explosion hit. If you didn\u2019t use Natural Instinct, just use another adrenaline potion or use limitless. Continue on and the ritual keepers should spawn very quickly within your Berserk. After it wears off, use your ZGS spec and continue to DPS through. When the third purple corruption appears, stand in one of the Ambassador\u2019s corners to properly place the corruption there, then run back to a safe spot and continue to DPS within your ZGS spec. If you get a black hole spawn, stun or Reprisal again. Continue to lower the Ambassador\u2019s LP down and get ready to use Berserk again right as he begins the black hands phase. DPS him down and use ZGS spec again, and he should be dead. Run around to block the healing smoke and place your ZGS spec under him so you can run while taking advantage of it. Alternatively you can continue to spam click under him to block all of the healing smoke without needing to move, though this is also the most click-intensive and difficult thing you can do. When the magic onslaught appears, you can use Devotion to block it, or use Reflect to reduce some damage. Be sure to eat up if you use Reflect though, as it can still hit hard. Resonance and dropping prayer for one tick is also another good thing you can do. Continue to block the healing smoke and DPS down the Ambassador, and you should get him down within time.

Room 5: There are two Crassian Scouts and two Cloaked Zealots spaced apart here. Aggro the zealots and move back a few steps to stack the mobs together for AoEs. Detonate may be used but is likely better for the next room. For melee line up your Cleave, Hurricane, and Quake to hit everything in one go. You only need to kill the two scouts and zealots to move to the next room. Example: https://youtu.be/VYA1tj-7dqg Room 6: This room has two groups of zombies. The first set will stack into your deto if you charge it near the entrance rather than surging past them. You don't want to draw aggro from the second group early as that splits them up and makes them harder to AoE. Most if not all of the second group is quickly lurable into a tsunami. For melee, hit the first group with Cleave then keep running past while putting on your salve amulet. Quake the second group, then run back to the middle to lure both groups of zombies next to you.

Room 9: There is a cloaked zealot and various scuttlers in this room you need to clear to proceed. You can generally stand behind the zealot and the scuttlers will md you for AoEs. Barge one of the scouts for both the Barge buff and faster movement. Bleed Assault on the zealot, then immediately target a scuttler to Hurricane and Quake. Room 10: Put your salve amulet back on. Very spread out zombies in here that are fairly annoying to AoE as mage. Most of the time you can catch most of them in a detonate fairly quickly and then finish off the stragglers with your remaining abilities. After letting them md you use Meteor Strike and a few AoEs. Activate Undead Slayer to speed up the process. Room 11: Run down a long path and jump down the cliff to clear an Ulthven Necromancer and two Huge Skeletons.

Finish off the horror with Flurry or other strong basics while you finish off the horror as quickly as possible. A lot of learners panic eat a ton here but the bridge can be done with no food Example: https://youtu.be/I_4wbqXoZaw Room 3: There's a line of three Acolytes of Seiryu guarding the gate here that must be cleared to proceed. They are melee and line up well for AoEs so just go to town here. Room 4: Bladed dive/surge through the staircase as marked to avoid aggroing the four acolytes and go all the way to the next gate. There are many mobs here but only the necromancers and Huge Skeletons must be cleared. For melee start with a Meteor Strike and finish off all the mobs with Quake and other AoE abilities. but make sure to have high adrenaline as the next room is the second boss, Taraket the Necromancer. Room 5: There is a Sea Witch and two Armoured Zombies in this room. Very straightforward, just dps and stack for AoEs as you see fit. Sea Witches have extremely delayed attacks for some reason so you may still take a moderate mage hit several seconds after it has died. Try not to use Assault because you\u2019ll want to save it for the next room, though. Room 6: Only the Kalgerion Demon needs to be killed here to proceed. He's really big and impossible to miss, activate Demon Slayer and Barge \u2192 Assault the Kal\u2019gerion demon. Finish off with more strong basics and thresholds. You can manipulate one of the required necromancers in room 7 to move from his position to make the next room easier on you by running as close as you can to him, so he aggros you through the wall. But this isn\u2019t 100% guaranteed, and if you don\u2019t get it simply skip it and proceed. Room 7: There's two necromancers (marked in red) hiding around in this room that need to be cleared. Just dump some thresholds and proceed. Room 8: Another two necromancers are guarding the gate here so just continue picking them off. The Sea Witches and Magister miniboss that can spawn at the east side of the room have a fairly large aggro range so preferably hug the wall as you enter. For melee, Quake and Decimate the first necromancer immediately. Slaughter and Surge at the exact same time to finish it off and move yourself quickly through the dungeon. Get on the other necromancer and finish it off with Hurricane and other strong basics. Finally, dive into the abyss to enter the final section of the dungeon. Room 1: There is a group of Crassian Warriors and scuttlers around the gate that must be killed. There's a decent amount of damage to do here so sunshine, detonate, etc., are recommended. They stack up very nicely for barrage autos and other AoEs and aren't very threatening in general. For melee, move to the gate and Barge a crassian warrior. Bleed Assault on it, and let the rest of the warriors gather to you, then finish them off with Cleave, Hurricane, and Quake. Save Meteor Strike for Room 3. Room 2: Two Warped Skeletons in here that can completely clear you if you aren't paying attention. If you sunned earlier at the previous gate, you can finish the remaining duration in here. The skeletons can deal a moderate mage hit frequently, healing themselves while dealing 2000-3000 damage to you. It's recommended to keep them snared/stunned to not have to deal with this. Room 3: There are two more Warped Skeletons along with three Cloaked Zealots guarding the gate. Run behind the line of zealots and detonate to clear this room fairly quickly. Once again, be wary of getting cleared by the skeletons but an ice barrage can freeze all the mobs in here nicely. For melee, Meteor Strike and AoE the zealots and skeletons all in one and finish off the rest of the mobs however you see fit. Room 4: The last room before the final boss of the dungeon. There are two more skeletons along with two Crassian Scouts that need to be cleared to proceed. They're pretty spread out so just dps and make sure to be on high adrenaline for the encounter with The Ambassador. There are three minibosses that can spawn in this room with a fairly inconvenient aggro range so avoid them by quickly Bladed Dive + Surging. For melee, Barge the crassian scouts, finish off the rest of the mobs, but try not to use Assault so you can more quickly use it for the start of Ambassador if you don\u2019t want to wait.","title":"Section 2"},{"location":"pvme-guides/mid-tier-pvm/the-shadow-reef/#the-crassian-leviathan","text":"As the first boss of The Shadow Reef, The Crassian Leviathan has a very small and easy set of area denial mechanics that can deal a lot of damage if ignored. The boss will also passively heal over the duration of the fight, although the amount is very negligible. Once you get used to the mechanics however, this fight should be extremely consistent and fast. Mechanics Poison pits + Additional heads: The center of the arena is filled with poison and is surrounded by the additional heads of the leviathan. This area deals constant poison damage and makes the player vulnerable to long stun attacks that the heads can use. The player should never stand in this zone during the fight, making this mechanic largely irrelevant. Dragon Breath: This will always be the first mechanic of the fight and is signaled by the leviathan firing a stationary breath attack in front of it, dealing rapid heavy damage. Simply stand off to the side to avoid this. Afterwards, reposition in front of the boss to avoid being caught in the next mechanic. Head Sweep: The leviathan will slam its' head across the ground twice, dealing very heavy damage to anyone caught in the area. This is avoided by moving to the opposite side of where the sweep begins, as seen here (applicable for melee with scythe): https://youtu.be/kOnRdfXKitI After going through one Dragon Breath and two sets of Head Sweeps, the leviathan will shortly move to other opposite side of the arena. Avoid entering the center here by bladed dive and surging across. Any bleed used will be considered walked as this transition occurs. It will then go through the same rotation, starting at Dragon Breath again, so position appropriately. Optimally, this fight can be completed in 90 seconds or less, shortly after the the boss swaps sides. Strategy (Melee only) For melee, you\u2019ll want to just get your Berserk and ZGS spec off. Within your Berserk, bleed Assault, fully channel Destroy, and 3 hit Flurry. Within ZGS, get at least a fully channeled Assault and Destroy off. Don\u2019t bother with a second Berserk, aim to just finish him off in one cycle with just Berserk and ZGS.","title":"The Crassian Leviathan"},{"location":"pvme-guides/mid-tier-pvm/the-shadow-reef/#taraket-the-necromancer","text":"This encounter is the second boss of the Shadow Reef, and is a clear step up in difficulty from the first. Taraket's mechanics revolve around spawning large amount of skeletal mobs that can deal heavy damage if ignored. As such, there are a large amount of targets in this fight and AoE abilities can be utilized to their full potential. The player can take a large amount of damage from all three combat styles, and having good DPS is an important factor in making this fight go smoothly. A Salve Amulet (e) should be used for the entire fight as it increases damage output drastically. Mechanics Rift of Undeath: Taraket will spawn a Rift of Undeath with 30,000 HP. This rift will spawn a large amount of ranged and melee skeletons that each deal low amounts of damage. After roughly 30 seconds, it will explode, dealing very heavy damage to the player. As such, it should be dealt with sometime in it's duration, preferably with some AoE abilities as that will clear the skeletons that spawn around it. Death's Swiftness: Taraket will shroud himself in a Death's Swiftness, becoming immobile and switching attack styles from mage to ranged. These autos will deal slightly more damage, especially if the player is maging the boss and therefore has worse ranged defence. This will happen fairly sporadically throughout the fight so just be ready to switch prayers at any point. Corpse Carrier and Bloated Monstrosity: Upon reaching 200,000 hitpoints, Taraket will become invulnerable and fly towards one of the two black crystals at the sides of the arena, healing himself and spawning the Corpse Carrier (west) or the Bloated Monstrosity (east), with 90,000 HP each. The Corpse Carrier will continuously spawn skeletal mobs as it's alive while the Bloated Monstrosity increases the damage of Taraket's attacks. Both of these attack with melee and are very easy to kite if needed. Taraket can only spawn these once each and will not heal upon hitting 200,000 HP afterwards. The first spawn is not random and can be forced by moving Taraket closer to the desired crystal, although he will always go east if he has not been moved. Spirit Line: Taraket will yell out \"Your efforts are meaningless, witness the fury of the dead!\" or \"I am the master of death!\" and summon a line of spirits from a random direction that will move towards the player, dealing rapid 2000+ damage upon contact. This is accompanied by a very strong (5000+) melee hit to anyone standing directly in front of him. Simply move out of the way accordingly when this happens and don't stay in front of the boss after the two crystals have been spawned. Strategy (Mage) Ancients is highly recommended to AoE the various targets down while staying on the boss. Undead Slayer Sigil and Salve Amulet (e) are extremely helpful as well. Start the fight with combust and escape to lure Taraket on top of his portal spawn location. The correct position for the player is roughly 2-3 squares from the wall. DPS the boss to 200,000 HP and the portal should be nearly dead from AoEs. Taraket will then move to spawn the Bloated Monstrosity. He can be kept in the lure spot by repositioning to MD east of him and then moving south 2 ticks after the skybox changes. This is inconsistent if the skeletons from the portal are also MD of him at the time so the boss may need to be relured. Lure example: https://youtu.be/7JGT6zV35CY Re-vuln and charge detonate on the boss. The Bloated Monstrosity should MD and the two can be caught in AoEs until the boss is DPSed back down to 200k. Try to keep the boss in the lure spot again and kill the monstrosity as Taraket is flying to spawn the Corpse Carrier. Lure and AoE the two while focusing on the Corpse Carrier. The skeletons that spawn at this point can be absorbed by the boss to uber heal himself and also add up to a lot of damage taken. DPS the boss down to 200,000 again and he will use Death's Swiftness and then 2x Spirit Wall. Stay MD and walk to the opposite side of the boss to avoid this mechanic. Flanking can be used at this time. Example: https://youtu.be/H7MfqLltWyg After this, the boss can be easily DPSed down to 0. Another rift may be spawned at some point but shouldn't be an issue if the lure has been maintained and/or the boss is low enough HP to ignore it. Strategy (Melee) There are three slightly different methods to this: killing both bloats for maximum safety, killing only the corpse carrier immediately to balance safety with speed, and just DPSing Taraket and tanking both bloats. What you do will slightly affect your rotation, but the overall goals remain the same. No matter how you do the fight, start with Berserk to Barge. Don\u2019t use adrenaline potions immediately as you\u2019d want to save it for later. Instead, just use limitless to get your thresholds off. If you were quick and started the fight while you still have your Meteor Strike buff from the previous room, the amount of adrenaline you will gain from critical hits will let you go bleed Assault -> 3 hit Flurry -> Destroy for the most optimal DPS rotation without an adrenaline potion. Otherwise, just 2 hit Flurry to Destroy. Regardless, dump the rest of your strong basics and the portal should spawn right before Taraket phases. Activate Undead Slayer right when you use your next ability after Assault. Destroy the portal immediately. Abilities like Blood Tendrils are fantastic for this purpose. After that, you can either get back on Taraket (the best way) or kill the bloated monstrosity ASAP (safer but slower). However you choose, use ZGS to either DPS down Taraket or the bloat, then focus on Taraket. If you ZGS Taraket, use Barge as soon as he\u2019s available to be hit with dual wield, then swap to ZGS to spec then to your terrasaur maul to get a lossless 2h auto for high damage. Bleed Assault and try to save Hurricane right before the 200k mark so you can overphase him and get an extra bit of damage before he runs off to heal and spawn the corpse carrier. If you want to kill the corpse carrier instantly, Barge -> Flurry on it, then Slaughter to Meteor Strike as more skeletons spawn from the corpse carrier for maximum adrenaline refunds. Finish it off quickly, then right after it\u2019s dead, use Berserk -> Barge + adrenaline potion -> bleed thresholds and finish Taraket off. Use ZGS spec after your Berserk wears off as well. Activate Undead Slayer with your Berserk as well. If you ignore the corpse carrier, Berserk -> Barge immediately when Taraket can be damaged again and simply outeat everything. This is extremely risky, but can be done fairly well even with blubbers and Guthix rests. As your ZGS spec will still be on cooldown, finish off the rest with strong basics and thresholds. Use Devotion if you really have to, but generally you don\u2019t need it. Deal with the mechanics just as you do with Magic and you\u2019ll be perfectly fine.","title":"Taraket the Necromancer"},{"location":"pvme-guides/mid-tier-pvm/the-shadow-reef/#kranon-the-ambassador","text":"At the bottom of the abyssal section awaits the Ambassador, the final boss of the Elite Dungeon 3. This boss has a moderate learning curve compared to most solo bosses and has a variety of mechanics ranging from DPS checks, area denial, and self-healing, as well as utilizing multiple combat styles. The boss primarily attacks with ranged, with a heavy mage attack after every 5 autos. The mage hit is replaced by a small but instant melee swipe if the player is in melee distance. Mechanics Purple Corruption: The Ambassador fires a spout into the player, dealing no damage and placing a bar over their head. When this bar nears depletion, a 5x5 area around the player will become corrupted until the boss reaches 400,000 hitpoints. This is similar to the Sanctum Guardian's mechanic from ED1 but will create two areas instead, separated by 2 ticks. These zones will last until the final phase of the fight and deal rapid 2000 damage to anyone standing inside. Black Hole: The Ambassador will spawn a black hole around the arena that will explode after a duration, dealing 8000+ damage to the player, this can be despawned by stunning it. Sinister Fragments: Six fragments will disperse from the boss to the edges of the arena with 20,000 HP each. At the same time, the Ambassador will fire three slowly rotating beams that last until the mechanic is over. Simply move between beams while DPSing the fragments down to 0. Dominion mines will deal 4000 damage each but if maging, decent rotations with ice spells and wrack in between abilities is more than sufficient to clear all fragments consistently. Touching the beams is essentially death but, as they always spawn in set locations (N, SE, SW), and rotate counterclockwise slowly, it's very easy to avoid. Crassian Ritual Keepers: Upon hitting 550,000 hitpoints, the Ambassador will begin to spawn Crassian Ritual Keepers that deal low ranged damage and make it harder to resonance his mage autos. These cannot be damaged and will continue to spawn until the boss reaches 400,000 hitpoints, when Seiryu appears at the north side of the arena, heals the player to full HP, and clears all corruption and Ritual Keepers shortly after. The end of this sequence signals the start of the final phase of the boss. Black Hands/Ritual Phase: A ring of black hands will spawn to encompass the edge of the arena. The Ambassador will stop doing his corruption and black hole mechanics and continue his auto attack pattern as normal. The hands will slam down in a clockwise fashion, sending constant smoke projectiles towards the ambassador. These will heal the boss 2500 HP for each smoke let in and can be blocked, directing a small amount of damage towards the player. Allowing the boss to heal makes this phase extremely long so it's important for the player to constantly be moving with the slams. Staying in melee distance of the Ambassador makes this require minimal movement and replaces his mage hits with weaker melee hits. After every 10 autoattacks during this phase, the Ambassador will say \"Fall now and be forgotten,\" sending 5 very heavy mage hits at the player. These can deal 8000+ damage each and must be negated through some defensive usage. However, devotion can only be used on every other instance of this and the smoke from the hands can snipe the player's resonance if they choose to use it. The common strategy for this is to alternate devotion and resonance + reflect or reprisal + reflect. This can still kill the player through 75% damage reduction so make good judgement calls on what to do if not using devotion. Ambassador's attack rotation Mage/Melee auto 5 autos Purple Corruption 5 autos (1 mage, 4 ranged) Black Hole 5 autos (1 ranged, 1 mage, 3 ranged) Purple Corruption 5 autos (2 ranged, 1 mage, 2 ranged) Sinister Fragments Repeat (auto attack pattern resumes, so next would be 3 ranged, 1 mage, 1 ranged) 550,000 HP - Crassian Ritual Keepers/phase 2 400,000 HP - Seiryu spawns Black Hands/Ritual Phase 10 autos Mage Onslaught Repeat Strategy (Mage) Start the fight with a full sunshine rotation and prayer flicking the Ambassador's auto attacks. Place corruption around the boss at the center so they don't interfere with you running around during fragments and stun black holes accordingly. This part is easily doable without using defensives or eating as long as you don't mess up prayers. During fragments, run around between beams spamming ice wrack, bleeds, wild magic, and asphyxiate. Try to end near full adrenaline and charge a detonate on Ambassador if you have extra time remaining. Release detonate and build back to sun (apot should come off cooldown perfectly). Do another full sun rotation and the second set of fragments should be skipped if the player's DPS is good. Otherwise, just keep going until the boss reaches 550k. If health begins to run low, the mage hits can be resonanced or just eat. Using devotion early on during Ritual Keepers allows you to resonance the mage hits risk free and it will come back up in time for mage onslaught later on. Try to not panic eat when the boss is nearing 400k HP as Seiryu will heal you to full. During the final phase, stand melee distance of the boss and start blocking the smokes appropriately, moving slowly clockwise. Don't sun too close to his mage onslaught (10 autos) or you may not have the adrenaline to devotion. The optimal sunshine location is straight on top of the boss as this allows the player to always be in their ultimate as they circle the Ambassador. Continue DPSing and do some combination of reflect, debilitate, resonance, reprisal, etc. on the second mage onslaught. If you're going to resonance, it's recommended to step out of the smoke to prevent it from being sniped. DPS to 0 and the fight is over. Strategy (Melee) Start the fight with a Berserk rotation. By the time you finish, the Ambassador should have laid down his first purple corruption. If you\u2019re not confident in your DPS, you can simply Surge away to place it somewhere else, then Barge back to ZGS spec to bleed Destroy. But if you\u2019re feeling good about your DPS, you can simply place it right next to the Ambassador and run through him to keep DPSing. Either way, lay down your ZGS and dump thresholds. For the black hole, you can choose to either go over to stun, or tank it with Reprisal. With TMW, tanking it and using it as recoil is a very nice source of damage. Do more damage with thresholds until the second corruption. This time, you have to place it away from the Ambassador. If your DPS is good, you should phase either immediately after you get the second corruption or 1-2 autoattacks after. If not, just place the corruption away then get back on Ambassador for a tiny bit before the sinister fragments spawn. Mid-fragments, just use your strong thresholds like Assault, Hurricane, and Blood Tendrils. You can even use Barge to bleed thresholds to wipe them out in essentially 2-3 abilities. Slaughter + Stomp is also a very good combo to wipe out fragments, especially with the masterwork spear of annihilation. If you\u2019re extremely struggling with fragments, Berserk for the first few spinners is an option, but it\u2019s not very efficient nor that much more effective over just thresholds and strong basics. If you want to min-max DPS against Ambassador, use dragon battleaxe after a Hurricane + 188% ability on the third fragment. Once you get back to 100% adrenaline, use Natural Instinct and build back to 100% adrenaline. By that point, the Ambassador should finish his spinning and be able to be damaged again with another Berserk rotation. Keep in mind that during this time, you can essentially only use basics so destroying all of the fragments is made much harder. You only need to kill 5 out of 6 and then use either Resonance or Disruption Shield (most preferred) to block the explosion hit. If you didn\u2019t use Natural Instinct, just use another adrenaline potion or use limitless. Continue on and the ritual keepers should spawn very quickly within your Berserk. After it wears off, use your ZGS spec and continue to DPS through. When the third purple corruption appears, stand in one of the Ambassador\u2019s corners to properly place the corruption there, then run back to a safe spot and continue to DPS within your ZGS spec. If you get a black hole spawn, stun or Reprisal again. Continue to lower the Ambassador\u2019s LP down and get ready to use Berserk again right as he begins the black hands phase. DPS him down and use ZGS spec again, and he should be dead. Run around to block the healing smoke and place your ZGS spec under him so you can run while taking advantage of it. Alternatively you can continue to spam click under him to block all of the healing smoke without needing to move, though this is also the most click-intensive and difficult thing you can do. When the magic onslaught appears, you can use Devotion to block it, or use Reflect to reduce some damage. Be sure to eat up if you use Reflect though, as it can still hit hard. Resonance and dropping prayer for one tick is also another good thing you can do. Continue to block the healing smoke and DPS down the Ambassador, and you should get him down within time.

Slow hitting abilities (Courtesy of @222668864704610305 and @130322872089575424 ) In RS, there are some abilities whose damage will go through one tick after they are activated, and some abilities whose damage will delay.

If your target is facing any other direction, flanking works from a 90-(90-the amount of degrees your target is from facing where you're standing)\u00b0 angle. In the below picture, black is your target, red is the direction your target is facing, and green is where flanking works. Freedom Autos (Courtesy of @425520655920791553 ) Freedom is unique in the respect that it can be used to force an offhand auto as well as a 2h auto within 3t. This has many uses like freedom vuln (using vuln instead of the offhand auto loses less damage than if you were to do it in place of a 2h auto), as well as accelerated adren gain because you get also adren from 2 autos. Mage: It's usually easier to time, and also often beneficial to do it immediately after a 2h abil, as this means the 2h auto comes at the same time as your next ability. You do this as follows: Tick 0: Activate abil with staff equipped Tick 0-3: Equip dual wield Tick 3: Click auto \u2192 freedom (you don't have to click the keybind for this auto if you just want a regular auto). Tick 4-6: Switch to staff Tick 6: Click auto \u2192 abil You can see a clip of this here: https://youtu.be/3vIVqAYj4Xk For other styles you'll need to do it after a dual wield ability (or delay your ability afterwards but this isn't worthwhile): Tick 0: Activate abil with dual wield equipped Tick 3: Activate freedom Tick 4: Equip 2h Tick 6: Activate abil You can see a clip of this here: https://youtu.be/YydKrY05Kc8 It's worth noting that if you're maging and freedom after a dual wield ability, to avoid losing autos you have to do a dual wield ability immediately after as well. Consider: any abil \u2192 dw abil \u2192 freedom (oh + 2h auto) \u2192 dw abil \u2192 auto + staff abil staff abil \u2192 freedom (oh + 2h auto) \u2192 any abil \u2192 dw abil \u2192 auto + staff abil If you just did a staff ability afterwards: staff abil \u2192 dw abil \u2192 freedom (oh + 2h auto) \u2192 any abil \u2192 dw abil you'd clearly lose an auto. You can also use freedom to cancel a channelled ability. In order to do this you have to click the target on the same tick you use freedom, or you won't get the offhand auto off. You also have to delay your subsequent ability by 1 tick in order to get your 2h auto off. Forcing an auto with defensives When using a defensive, an auto attack will be fired. When using , this auto attack can be changed from a normal auto into a utility spell, such as or . This is done by pressing the keybind for or , followed by the keybind for , , , or . Switching Weapons during Detonate (Courtesy of @185315527571406848 ) During the detonate channel, it is possible to switch weapons without Detonate being released. It is also possible to channel shield dome inside detonate, provided detonate is pressed first. This will cost the auto on detonate release, but is situationally useful at Vorago. It is also worth noting that it's possible to Spellbook Swap in deto, allowing for a vuln release. https://youtu.be/OxXEWwHODwQ Shield Dome Detonate In certain cases, most notably at Vorago, it is beneficial to be in shield dome while channelling detonate. This is done by channelling detonate, then channelling shield dome. This will result in a lost auto, but can be prevented by sipping a super restore or an overload salve to cancel the shield dome. https://youtu.be/wxoyeMobO_o Dragon Battleaxe Spec The Dragon battleaxe has a unique spec that is often used in speed kills due to providing a noticeable damage increase at the cost of a large amount of adrenaline, therefore is quite useful when prepared before hand or in other niche situations. The Spec works as following, by draining 10% (rounded down) of your attack, range, magic, and defence levels, and you will be given a strength level boost of 10 + 1 level for every 4 drained from your other stats, as well as a hidden damage boost of 1.2x your damage, this also stacks with Zaros godsword spec going from a 1.25x to 1.5x boost, or 1.1x when under the effect of berserk, making berserk a 2.2x damage boost. This boost overall lasts 1 minute. It\u2019s most common uses are setup before hand for a speed/record kills where you will Dragon battleaxe in conjunction with natural instinct to make the most of the boost before going into the kill, or for an Araxxor p3 skip and certain 1 cycle core Solak rotations. Bladed Dive Angle After using Bladed Dive it will leave your character facing a consistent direction. It's important to be comfortable with this so you can Bladed Dive \u2192 Surge and move in a predictable manner.

Inputs for grimshaw with 4taa, in order (bracket groups indicate inputs in a single tick): [Have Active Grimoire + Staff Equipped ] > [Auto > Ability > Equip Scrimshaw > Activate Pocket Slot] \u200e \u200e> [Equip Grimoire] \u200e \u200e> [Activate Grimoire] [Have Active Grimoire +DW Equipped ] > [Ability > Equip Scrimshaw > Activate Pocket Slot] \u200e \u200e> [Equip Grimoire] \u200e \u200e> [Activate Grimoire + Equip Staff] Demonstration https://youtu.be/M65xdRYYxJ4 Walking bosses in RS (courtesy of @236955913859104778 ) In RS, bosses only walk east, west, or south (never north). The direction they walk is random at first, but they will always walk in that direction afterwards. Hitting a wall changes walking behavior in the following ways: an east-walking boss will turn west, a west-walking boss will turn south, and a south-walking boss will turn either east or west. While walking isn\u2019t as insanely overpowered as it once was, it still has a variety of applications. The simplest of these include walking a bleed such as combust, frag, or slaughter. A more advanced version of this is using a bleed, and then immediately using surge to go under the boss and bladed dive to get back all within a GCD. This allows you to double bleed damage against bosses when you aren't MD. Couchy demonstrates it in this clip: https://clips.twitch.tv/CorrectConcernedGrouseNerfRedBlaster Keep in mind that most bosses move at 2 squares per tick (same speed as you), so for bosses that you don\u2019t want to walk (such as AoD), you should move 2 squares (or more generally just an even number) to prevent unwanted movement. Walking can also be used to reposition a boss, such as fixing base spot on P2 Vorago, moving Vorago out of green bomb mists, and moving Telos out of beams. Manual Spell Casting (courtesy of @133391081109716992 and @150675804596994048 ) Currently, magic auto attacks deal damage based on the spell your weapon is set to. The Surge, Blitz, and Barrage spells deal damage scaling up to T92 while other spells are capped at a lower tier. Particularly, the Aurora spells are capped at T90 damage and below, making them undesirable to use despite their secondary effects. However, this issue is resolved with manual spell casting found in the combat settings. This toggle makes it so that the autocast spell that the player's weapon is set to does not change even if they attack with a different spell. Without this toggle, if the player's spell is set to Blood Barrage and they use Ruby Aurora, for example, their autocast spell will be set to the latter, capping all damage they deal from T92 down to T90. With manual spell casting toggled, the autocast spell stays locked on Blood Barrage, keeping ability damage set to T92 regardless of what spell the player manually inputs. This is due to magic ability damage being based on the current autocast spell, not the spell the player last attacked with. Applications On the normal spellbook, this allows the player to attack with Air Strike instead of Air Surge (although the autocast spell must still be set to Surge), reducing rune costs from 5 Air Runes per attack down to 1. For those who are worried about rune costs while 4 tick auto attacking, this relieves much of the problem. On the ancients spellbook, the Aurora spells can be used while maintaining T92 damage, so long as the player's autocast spell is set to a Blitz or Barrage spell. Ruby Aurora is the most useful of the set as it increases the damage of nearby teammates by up to 3%. This effect has existed for a long time but it was used at a DPS loss to the caster. Emerald Aurora provides damage reduction up to 5% on a personal basis, potentially allowing some use in a solo pvm situation. The other two Auroras boost prism effectiveness and likely won't see use until prisms themselves become meta. Blood Burst, the lower tier of Blood Barrage, can also be used to save on rune costs and have the same damage and effects of Barrage under manual spell casting. At Telos, manual spell casting may be used to prevent the player from accidentally auto attacking with an Ice spell when it may be undesirable to do so. For example, binding Telos in the black beam or breaking his Freedom at a poor time can be the result of using Ice Blitz/Barrage earlier and having it set to the autocast spell with manual spell casting toggled off. With the toggle on, however, the player has increased control over when to bind Telos and potential ping spikes won't have as much of an unintended consequence. Autocast Spell Selection (courtesy of @244845124712923137 ) When selecting an autocast spell, be sure to manually select it with dual-wield (main-hand + off-hand). Selecting your autocast with a two-handed weapon will only apply it to the main-hand, thus setting no off-hand spell, causing you to do 2/3 damage when doing dual-wield abilities in this manner. Here is a comparison. First example is selecting your autocast with two-handed weapon first (main-hand autocast). Second example is selecting your autocast with dual-wield weapon first (main-hand + off-hand autocast). https://youtu.be/IUmvGm4Z374 How Adren Gaining Without a Target Works, Courtesy of @236955913859104778 Have you ever entered Telos, used devo, and lost 15% adren because you forgot to lose target? Well fret not, because in this short guide I will explain how adren gaining with an out-of-range (or dead) target works. Essentially, after doing your last damaging ability on an NPC, you can use any abilities to gain adren for then next 10 seconds. After that, defensive basics will no longer give adren. However, there is an important caveat: you will only be unable to gain adren for 10 seconds. After that, you can use ONE defensive basic that will give you adren, after which you will be unable to gain adren again for 10s. Think of this as a cooldown - 10s after the last damaging ability on a boss, you will only be able to build once every 10s. The following abilities do not affect or reset this \u201ccooldown\u201d: \u2b25 Non-defensive abilities that do not require a target (surge, escape, and bd) \u2b25 Defensive thresholds (these will always take 15 adren unless you lose target, and their use does not affect the CD) \u2b25 Ultimates that do not require a target An example showcasing the latter (ultimates not affecting this cooldown) would be not losing target after an AoD kill, then starting off the next kill with sunshine + a defensive basic that was used NO EARLIER than 10s after the previous defensive basic you used to stall adren. For example, you would be able to use anticipate to stall, sunshine when your anticipate timer is at 2s, then use another defensive basic like freedom after anticipate has run out. Note that all this does not apply on targets that automatically force you to lose target after death (e.g. Araxxi, Telos, etc.) Some useful areas of application: AoD, Vorago phase transitions, COMBAT DUMMIES, and various other bosses where you can still gain adren after killing them (may potentially work on an exhaustive list) Tl;dr: if you ever accidentally use a defensive thresh without losing target or can no longer build with defensive basics, simply wait 10s (stalling with surge/escape/bd) and use another defensive. From this point, you will only be able to use 1 defensive basic to build every 10s\u2026 making it necessary to use surge/escape/bd in between all this time. The True Centre of a Boss is Always South-West, Courtesy of @175995416955977728 : This affects abilities like corruption blast/shot and detonate. In the picture with the combat dummy, the true centre is in the centre because the size of the dummy is 1 square, but any monster 2 by 2 or larger has a south-west centre. In picture a, the detonate green arrows are on the centre of the dragon, meaning the dragon to the north will not be hit by the detonate In picture b, the arrows are perfectly aligned and will allow detonate to hit both dragons. This means you should always try to detonate a monster that is north east of another monster to maximize the amount of targets hit. Note that this works with other forms of AoE as well, such as mechanized chinchompas. Camera Shaking Toggle (by @216433706343202816 ) If you suffer from motion sickness, you may toggle this off in the settings menu. This is particularly useful for Rise of the Six tunnels, or usage of Quake. However be aware that camera shake often helps indicate a mechanic is about to happen, for example at Solak or Black Stone Dragon.

Short video guide on this topic: https://youtu.be/fInvWvnSI18 Video transcript: https://pastebin.com/4jtB3RYh Saving Aftershock while using specs (Courtesy of @358148685718093827 ) When using a special attack such as aftershock stacks are lost due to switching to an unperked weapon, this is avoided by swapping to and from your spec weapon within the same tick. Due to the inability to input the same weapon bind twice in one tick you must swap from 2h to dual or dual to 2h. (All inputs must be done in the correct order AND within the same game tick to be successful) Starting with 2h: [optional 4t auto] > > > > Starting with Dual: [optional 4t debuff] > \u200e \u200e> \u200e \u200e> https://youtu.be/jqeed0LKPUU Weapon Poison Guide (Courtesy to @108682527304060928 ) Weapon Poison provides a buff to the player for an amount of time dependent on the grade of poison being used. While this is active, players have a 1/6 chance of poisoning a target so long as they are not poison-immune. After being poisoned, the target will take damage every 16 game ticks, or 9.6 seconds, and will continue to take damage for 3 minutes. This 3 minute duration also has a chance to be refreshed at a 1/6 rate. Poison damage will hit 2 ticks after the damage that applied it. Generally the only poison one would want to use is Weapon Poison+++ , which lasts for 12 minutes and deals an average of 27.9% ability damage for each hit. Vulnerability affects this damage, but prayers and damage boosting ultimates do not. Additionally, Cinderbane Gloves heavily boost the amount of damage that can be dealt by poison. While worn, the gloves effectively ignore the 16 tick cooldown on poison damage, allowing for a 1/6 chance of reapplication and refreshing the poison timer on the target. This reapplication will incur an extra poison hit, and the 16 tick damage timer is also reset. This effect also allows for poison to reapply itself, so each poison hitsplat also has a 1/6 chance of dealing an extra poison hit and refreshing the timer. Without using weapon poison, the damage supplied by Cinderbane Gloves' own poison will be closer to that of Weapon Poison+. However, they increase the damage that applied weapon poison deals; The +++ variant is increased to an average 36.5% ability damage from 27.9%. Coupled with Kwuarm incense sticks, this value raises further to 46.5%. Poison can be applied/refreshed by any player-sourced damage . This includes: \u2b25 Auto attacks (including vulnerability) \u2b25 Abilities (including bleeds) \u2b25 God books \u2b25 Reflect damage \u2b25 Blood necklaces \u2b25 Cannon damage \u2b25 Puncture bleeds \u2b25 Poison damage \u2b25 Wyvern Crossbow passive \u2b25 Eldritch Crossbow special \u2b25 Dominion mines","title":"Mechanics"},{"location":"pvme-guides/miscellaneous-information/mechanics/#mechanics","text":"","title":"Mechanics"},{"location":"pvme-guides/miscellaneous-information/mechanics/#target-cycling","text":"Targeting settings can be found under the Combat Tab in the Settings Interface and includes the situationally useful Cycle Target keybinds.

Hitting a wall changes walking behavior in the following ways: an east-walking boss will turn west, a west-walking boss will turn south, and a south-walking boss will turn either east or west. While walking isn\u2019t as insanely overpowered as it once was, it still has a variety of applications. The simplest of these include walking a bleed such as combust, frag, or slaughter. A more advanced version of this is using a bleed, and then immediately using surge to go under the boss and bladed dive to get back all within a GCD. This allows you to double bleed damage against bosses when you aren't MD. Couchy demonstrates it in this clip: https://clips.twitch.tv/CorrectConcernedGrouseNerfRedBlaster Keep in mind that most bosses move at 2 squares per tick (same speed as you), so for bosses that you don\u2019t want to walk (such as AoD), you should move 2 squares (or more generally just an even number) to prevent unwanted movement. Walking can also be used to reposition a boss, such as fixing base spot on P2 Vorago, moving Vorago out of green bomb mists, and moving Telos out of beams.","title":"Walking bosses in RS (courtesy of \u0002amp\u0003#64;\u0002amp\u0003#50;\u0002amp\u0003#51;\u0002amp\u0003#54;\u0002amp\u0003#57;\u0002amp\u0003#53;\u0002amp\u0003#53;\u0002amp\u0003#57;\u0002amp\u0003#49;\u0002amp\u0003#51;\u0002amp\u0003#56;\u0002amp\u0003#53;\u0002amp\u0003#57;\u0002amp\u0003#49;\u0002amp\u0003#48;\u0002amp\u0003#52;\u0002amp\u0003#55;\u0002amp\u0003#55;\u0002amp\u0003#56;)"},{"location":"pvme-guides/miscellaneous-information/mechanics/#manual-spell-casting-courtesy-of-amp64amp49amp51amp51amp51amp57amp49amp48amp56amp49amp49amp48amp57amp55amp49amp54amp57amp57amp50-and-amp64amp49amp53amp48amp54amp55amp53amp56amp48amp52amp53amp57amp54amp57amp57amp52amp48amp52amp56","text":"Currently, magic auto attacks deal damage based on the spell your weapon is set to. The Surge, Blitz, and Barrage spells deal damage scaling up to T92 while other spells are capped at a lower tier. Particularly, the Aurora spells are capped at T90 damage and below, making them undesirable to use despite their secondary effects. However, this issue is resolved with manual spell casting found in the combat settings. This toggle makes it so that the autocast spell that the player's weapon is set to does not change even if they attack with a different spell. Without this toggle, if the player's spell is set to Blood Barrage and they use Ruby Aurora, for example, their autocast spell will be set to the latter, capping all damage they deal from T92 down to T90. With manual spell casting toggled, the autocast spell stays locked on Blood Barrage, keeping ability damage set to T92 regardless of what spell the player manually inputs. This is due to magic ability damage being based on the current autocast spell, not the spell the player last attacked with. Applications On the normal spellbook, this allows the player to attack with Air Strike instead of Air Surge (although the autocast spell must still be set to Surge), reducing rune costs from 5 Air Runes per attack down to 1. For those who are worried about rune costs while 4 tick auto attacking, this relieves much of the problem. On the ancients spellbook, the Aurora spells can be used while maintaining T92 damage, so long as the player's autocast spell is set to a Blitz or Barrage spell. Ruby Aurora is the most useful of the set as it increases the damage of nearby teammates by up to 3%. This effect has existed for a long time but it was used at a DPS loss to the caster. Emerald Aurora provides damage reduction up to 5% on a personal basis, potentially allowing some use in a solo pvm situation. The other two Auroras boost prism effectiveness and likely won't see use until prisms themselves become meta. Blood Burst, the lower tier of Blood Barrage, can also be used to save on rune costs and have the same damage and effects of Barrage under manual spell casting. At Telos, manual spell casting may be used to prevent the player from accidentally auto attacking with an Ice spell when it may be undesirable to do so. For example, binding Telos in the black beam or breaking his Freedom at a poor time can be the result of using Ice Blitz/Barrage earlier and having it set to the autocast spell with manual spell casting toggled off. With the toggle on, however, the player has increased control over when to bind Telos and potential ping spikes won't have as much of an unintended consequence.","title":"Manual Spell Casting (courtesy of \u0002amp\u0003#64;\u0002amp\u0003#49;\u0002amp\u0003#51;\u0002amp\u0003#51;\u0002amp\u0003#51;\u0002amp\u0003#57;\u0002amp\u0003#49;\u0002amp\u0003#48;\u0002amp\u0003#56;\u0002amp\u0003#49;\u0002amp\u0003#49;\u0002amp\u0003#48;\u0002amp\u0003#57;\u0002amp\u0003#55;\u0002amp\u0003#49;\u0002amp\u0003#54;\u0002amp\u0003#57;\u0002amp\u0003#57;\u0002amp\u0003#50; and \u0002amp\u0003#64;\u0002amp\u0003#49;\u0002amp\u0003#53;\u0002amp\u0003#48;\u0002amp\u0003#54;\u0002amp\u0003#55;\u0002amp\u0003#53;\u0002amp\u0003#56;\u0002amp\u0003#48;\u0002amp\u0003#52;\u0002amp\u0003#53;\u0002amp\u0003#57;\u0002amp\u0003#54;\u0002amp\u0003#57;\u0002amp\u0003#57;\u0002amp\u0003#52;\u0002amp\u0003#48;\u0002amp\u0003#52;\u0002amp\u0003#56;)"},{"location":"pvme-guides/miscellaneous-information/mechanics/#autocast-spell-selection-courtesy-of-amp64amp50amp52amp52amp56amp52amp53amp49amp50amp52amp55amp49amp50amp57amp50amp51amp49amp51amp55","text":"When selecting an autocast spell, be sure to manually select it with dual-wield (main-hand + off-hand).

Well fret not, because in this short guide I will explain how adren gaining with an out-of-range (or dead) target works. Essentially, after doing your last damaging ability on an NPC, you can use any abilities to gain adren for then next 10 seconds. After that, defensive basics will no longer give adren. However, there is an important caveat: you will only be unable to gain adren for 10 seconds. After that, you can use ONE defensive basic that will give you adren, after which you will be unable to gain adren again for 10s. Think of this as a cooldown - 10s after the last damaging ability on a boss, you will only be able to build once every 10s. The following abilities do not affect or reset this \u201ccooldown\u201d: \u2b25 Non-defensive abilities that do not require a target (surge, escape, and bd) \u2b25 Defensive thresholds (these will always take 15 adren unless you lose target, and their use does not affect the CD) \u2b25 Ultimates that do not require a target An example showcasing the latter (ultimates not affecting this cooldown) would be not losing target after an AoD kill, then starting off the next kill with sunshine + a defensive basic that was used NO EARLIER than 10s after the previous defensive basic you used to stall adren. For example, you would be able to use anticipate to stall, sunshine when your anticipate timer is at 2s, then use another defensive basic like freedom after anticipate has run out. Note that all this does not apply on targets that automatically force you to lose target after death (e.g. Araxxi, Telos, etc.) Some useful areas of application: AoD, Vorago phase transitions, COMBAT DUMMIES, and various other bosses where you can still gain adren after killing them (may potentially work on an exhaustive list) Tl;dr: if you ever accidentally use a defensive thresh without losing target or can no longer build with defensive basics, simply wait 10s (stalling with surge/escape/bd) and use another defensive. From this point, you will only be able to use 1 defensive basic to build every 10s\u2026 making it necessary to use surge/escape/bd in between all this time.","title":"How Adren Gaining Without a Target Works, Courtesy of \u0002amp\u0003#64;\u0002amp\u0003#50;\u0002amp\u0003#51;\u0002amp\u0003#54;\u0002amp\u0003#57;\u0002amp\u0003#53;\u0002amp\u0003#53;\u0002amp\u0003#57;\u0002amp\u0003#49;\u0002amp\u0003#51;\u0002amp\u0003#56;\u0002amp\u0003#53;\u0002amp\u0003#57;\u0002amp\u0003#49;\u0002amp\u0003#48;\u0002amp\u0003#52;\u0002amp\u0003#55;\u0002amp\u0003#55;\u0002amp\u0003#56;"},{"location":"pvme-guides/miscellaneous-information/mechanics/#the-true-centre-of-a-boss-is-always-south-west-courtesy-of-amp64amp49amp55amp53amp57amp57amp53amp52amp49amp54amp57amp53amp53amp57amp55amp55amp55amp50amp56","text":"This affects abilities like corruption blast/shot and detonate.

Incense stick guide Incense sticks are a consumable created by combining logs, ashes, and herbs. They have a variety of uses between skilling and combat, but we will only be covering those that have a pvm related boost. Each incense stick increases the buff duration by 10 minutes. Incense sticks have a potency from 1-4. This increases by 1 every 10 minutes (30 minutes till max potency), or you can 'overload' and instantly boost to max potency at the cost of 6 sticks (still only 10 minutes added duration though). This would increase the cost for 1 hour to 11 incense sticks instead of just 6, but more sticks can be added to keep the boosts up indefinitely assuming your buff doesn't expire. Dying will cancel your incense boost as a whole causing you to have to re-incense, even if you use a ring of death or practice mode. In practice, overloading instantly is almost always better. You can have up to 3 different effects active at once at 95 firemaking. The relevant incense sticks with pvm benefits are listed as follows: \u2b25 Ranarr: Each potency level gives a +1 prayer bonus (functionally useless) \u2b25 Spirit Weed: Each potency level provides a 10% increased familiar special attack recovery rate \u2b25 Irit: Each potency level reduces poison damage by 25% \u2b25 Kwuarm: Each potency level provides +2.5% weapon poison damage \u2b25 Lantadyme: Each potency level increases potion timer by 30 seconds. Not usually cost effective to use but can reduce the need to make more overloads. \u2b25 Fellstalk (For Slayer): Each potency level provides a x1.01 chance to spawn elite monsters Incense sticks are rather expensive to use in dangerous pvm due to having to re-incense upon death, so it is advised to only use them in higher level pvm where there benefits are quite tangible for their value or where their cost will be offset by profit. But here is a general list of where you would use certain incense sticks. Kalphite King: Spirit Weed, Kwuarm, Lantadyme GWD2: Spirit Weed, Kwuarm (at Helwyr and Greg), Lantadyme, Irit (At Greg) Elite Dungeons: Spirit Weed, Kwuarm, Lantadyme Angel of Death: Spirit Weed, Kwuarm, Lantadyme Araxxor: Lantadyme, Irit if not using salves/venomblood Raids: Spirit Weed, Kwuarm, Lantadyme Magister: Spirit Weed, Kwuarm, Lantadyme Rots: Lantadyme Solak: Spirit Weed, Kwuarm, Lantadyme Telos: Kwuarm, Lantadyme, (Spirit Weed if using ripper, or mammoth for eating maybe) Vorago: Lantadyme Summoning (Lvl 87/99) \u2b25 Nihil \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Nihils boost their users Melee/Ranged/Magic accuracy by 5% depending on nihil summoned \u2b25 Priority: High \u2b25 Steel Titan \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 DPS familiar \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Note: Should set the special attacks to occur every 1 attack when scrolls are stored in it \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Note: Can also spam click its special to fire off specs faster \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u2b25 Often used in conjunction with Spiritual Prayer flasks to spam its special attack for a bigger dps buff \u2b25 Can be used as a cheaper alternative to ripper demon, however there is a significant difference \u2b25 Priority: High \u2b25 Ripper Demon \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Best DPS familiar \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Note: Should set the special attacks to occur every 1 attack when scrolls are stored in it \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Note: Can also spam click its special to fire off specs faster \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u2b25 Often used in conjunction with Spiritual Prayer flasks to spam its special attack for a bigger dps buff \u2b25 Has a passive effect that allows you to deal more damage the lower your targets HP is, this works even if the ripper can't attack your target e.g. Seiryu crystals. \u2b25 Priority: High Bakriminel Bolts Enchanted bakriminel bolts provide various effects which can be very useful in certain pvm scenarios. If you are using DW weapons it is highly recommended that you use bakriminel bolts for increased DPM. Here's a rundown of the current meta. If a bolt does not appear on this list, it is not considered meta . Ruby bolts - Overall best dps bolt for general pvm. 5% chance to activate, replacing a hit with a new one based on target's HP. The bolts have a shared cooldown per target, making them less effective (but still very powerful) in groups. Around ~70k HP, it is recommended to switch to another type of bolt, as ruby bolts can reduce DPS if the bolt damage is less than the original hit. Diamond bolts - Improves accuracy. Useful for bosses where you want the extra accuracy above all else (eg. Rise of the Six). Onyx bolts - 10% chance to activate, heals 25% of the hit that triggered activation. Also increases damage by 25% on activation. Great for sustained healing, and alternative bolts after ruby bolts are no longer effective. Expensive.

They have a variety of uses between skilling and combat, but we will only be covering those that have a pvm related boost. Each incense stick increases the buff duration by 10 minutes. Incense sticks have a potency from 1-4. This increases by 1 every 10 minutes (30 minutes till max potency), or you can 'overload' and instantly boost to max potency at the cost of 6 sticks (still only 10 minutes added duration though). This would increase the cost for 1 hour to 11 incense sticks instead of just 6, but more sticks can be added to keep the boosts up indefinitely assuming your buff doesn't expire. Dying will cancel your incense boost as a whole causing you to have to re-incense, even if you use a ring of death or practice mode. In practice, overloading instantly is almost always better. You can have up to 3 different effects active at once at 95 firemaking. The relevant incense sticks with pvm benefits are listed as follows: \u2b25 Ranarr: Each potency level gives a +1 prayer bonus (functionally useless) \u2b25 Spirit Weed: Each potency level provides a 10% increased familiar special attack recovery rate \u2b25 Irit: Each potency level reduces poison damage by 25% \u2b25 Kwuarm: Each potency level provides +2.5% weapon poison damage \u2b25 Lantadyme: Each potency level increases potion timer by 30 seconds. Not usually cost effective to use but can reduce the need to make more overloads. \u2b25 Fellstalk (For Slayer): Each potency level provides a x1.01 chance to spawn elite monsters Incense sticks are rather expensive to use in dangerous pvm due to having to re-incense upon death, so it is advised to only use them in higher level pvm where there benefits are quite tangible for their value or where their cost will be offset by profit.

If you are using DW weapons it is highly recommended that you use bakriminel bolts for increased DPM. Here's a rundown of the current meta. If a bolt does not appear on this list, it is not considered meta . Ruby bolts - Overall best dps bolt for general pvm. 5% chance to activate, replacing a hit with a new one based on target's HP. The bolts have a shared cooldown per target, making them less effective (but still very powerful) in groups. Around ~70k HP, it is recommended to switch to another type of bolt, as ruby bolts can reduce DPS if the bolt damage is less than the original hit. Diamond bolts - Improves accuracy. Useful for bosses where you want the extra accuracy above all else (eg. Rise of the Six). Onyx bolts - 10% chance to activate, heals 25% of the hit that triggered activation. Also increases damage by 25% on activation. Great for sustained healing, and alternative bolts after ruby bolts are no longer effective. Expensive. Hydrix bolts - 10% chance to activate, immediately granting 10% adren, and +1% on basics for 15 seconds. Used as a utility bolt for pumping out more thresholds while in Death's Swiftness.
